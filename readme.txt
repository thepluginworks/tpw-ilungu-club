Free base platform for shared member, payment, page, and admin tools across iLungu Club-powered WordPress sites and add-on plugins.

== Description ==

iLungu™ Club is the free base platform that powers the iLungu Club plugin ecosystem.

It provides shared functionality used across add-ons and integrations, ensuring everything works together consistently and reliably.

With iLungu Club installed, your plugins can:

- manage member accounts, roles, and profiles
- handle login, registration, and access control
- process payments and track transactions
- apply consistent branding and UI styles
- share system pages and common functionality across modules

iLungu Club is required by many ecosystem plugins and is typically installed automatically when needed.

You do not use iLungu Club directly in the same way as a feature add-on — it works behind the scenes to support the plugins you install.

https://www.thepluginworks.com

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/tpw-ilungu-club/` or install it using your normal plugin deployment process.
2. Activate `tpw-ilungu-club/ilungu-club.php` as iLungu™ Club in WordPress.
3. When replacing the previous physical plugin identity, deactivate `tpw-flexiclub/tpw-flexiclub.php` first at the same single-site or network scope. Never activate both copies together.
4. Activate any add-on plugins that require iLungu Club.
5. Review shared settings under Settings > iLungu Club.
6. Check that your required login, profile, join, or thank-you pages are set up for the TPW modules you use.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is iLungu Club used for? =
iLungu Club provides the shared services and admin tools used by ecosystem plugins, including member flows, payments, shared pages, and common settings.

= Can I use iLungu Club on its own? =
Usually it is used together with other iLungu Club add-ons. Some shared screens and shortcodes may still be available on their own, but its main role is to support the wider plugin set.

= Where do I manage core settings? =
Go to Settings > iLungu Club in the WordPress admin area.

= Do I need to create any pages? =
Many iLungu Club setups use shared pages such as login, profile, join, control, or thank-you pages. The exact pages depend on which plugins are active on your site.

== Shortcodes ==

= [tpw_member_login] =
Displays a front-end member login form.

= [tpw_member_profile] =
Displays the member profile area.

= [tpw_join_form] =
Displays the public join or signup form when the join system is enabled.

= [tpw_thank_you] =
Displays a thank-you or confirmation view for supported TPW payment and RSVP flows.

= [tpw-control] =
Displays the TPW Control front-end admin hub where this is enabled for your site.

== Changelog ==

= 2.11.1 =
- Added the checkout-safe payment method API used by iLungu Club add-ons. Only released, active, configured, and available methods can be offered at checkout.
- Prevented inactive Bank Transfer settings from being exposed through checkout payment method discovery.

= 2.11.0 =
- Renamed the distributed plugin identity to iLungu Club, including the plugin package, updater channel, and release artifacts, while preserving existing technical identifiers for compatibility.
- Added the Club Management front-end workspace and canonical System Pages route, including safer page ownership and collision handling.
- Improved Club Management settings and System Pages rendering, including the current iLungu Club owner label.

= 2.10.2 =
- Payments: fixed Square/Core checkout frontend errors so mount, config, or SDK failures shown in `#tpw-square-errors` are visible instead of staying hidden behind inline `display:none`.

= 2.10.1 =
- Payments: restored creation and repair of the shared RSVP payments table on activation and existing-site upgrade paths so payment rows can be created reliably again.

= 2.10.0 =
- Email: added durable queued email delivery backed by Action Scheduler, with queue status visibility, retry handling, and recovery for missing scheduled actions.
- Email: preserved immediate send behaviour for immediate-sensitive workflows while routing queue-safe notifications through the new background queue.
- Members: tightened shared admin and member workflow safeguards that shipped alongside the queue rollout.

= 2.9.2 =
- Admin UI: adjusted scoped TPW button styling so `.tpw-btn-*` variants retain their intended typography.

= 2.9.1 =
- Noticeboard: restored normal WordPress single-template ownership for individual notices so active themes and Elementor Single templates can control `tpw_notice` permalinks by default, while keeping the legacy bundled single template available only through an explicit compatibility filter.
- Noticeboard: aligned the `tpw_notice` custom post type registration with more conventional public labels and builder-facing args so page builders can expose cleaner all-notice single-template conditions without changing existing permalink behaviour.

= 2.9.0 =
- System Pages: Manage Members and Noticeboard are now first-class FlexiClub System Pages with runtime auto-provisioning and duplicate-safe reuse of existing published pages.
- Members Menu: the built-in Noticeboard and Members destinations now resolve through the canonical System Pages registry while preserving existing compatibility fallbacks.
- Documentation: aligned the shipped System Pages docs with the current Core contract for Manage Members and Noticeboard.

= 2.8.0 =
- Members Menu: add-on plugins can now register managed FlexiClub Members Menu items through a shared Core contract instead of writing menu items directly.
- Members Menu: managed item visibility is now evaluated centrally by FlexiClub/Core so add-ons only declare login and visibility metadata.
- System Pages: restored logged-out automatic page-list protection for both classic page lists and block-theme `core/page-list` navigation fallbacks so private FlexiClub pages stay hidden automatically.

= 2.7.0 =
- Members Menu: added a safer default FlexiClub Members Menu setup and repair flow so shared member navigation can be restored on existing installs without reactivation.
- System Pages: extended logged-out automatic page-list protection so private FlexiClub pages stay hidden in both classic fallback menus and block-theme page-list navigation.
- Noticeboard: the default front-end Noticeboard is now members-only by default, while existing notice management access for authorised admins and notice managers remains intact.
- Documentation: added the canonical System Page Protection contract and aligned the bundled help docs with the current shared Core behaviour.

= 2.6.1 =
- Noticeboard: improved the front-end notice editor modal so the active module layout opens correctly with the updated flex-based shell and better mobile sizing.
- Noticeboard: clarified the canonical module asset and shortcode paths in the bundled docs while keeping the older root noticeboard assets and includes-based bootstraps as temporary compatibility copies.

= 2.6.0 =
- Added front-end Payment Method detail routing inside the FlexiClub Settings workspace so supported offline methods can be configured without leaving the portal.
- Kept shared Payment Method save flows and admin pages aligned so existing wp-admin configuration pages continue to work while front-end settings routes return correctly after save.
- Removed SumUp and WooCommerce from the shared Payment Methods list while those integrations remain development-only surfaces, and refreshed the shared payment list styling so enable toggles and status pills are clearer in both admin and front-end settings.

= 2.5.0 =
- Added dedicated front-end Menu Management, Archival System, and Logs workspaces inside the `[flexiclub]` portal while keeping the existing legacy TPW Control page available for transition.
- Expanded the FlexiClub portal so key workspace links, activity cards, plugin management buttons, and compatible add-on activation flows stay in the front end instead of sending authorised users back to wp-admin.
- Improved portal routing and layout reliability so the main dashboard opens correctly, the new Logs page resolves safely, and the front-end dashboard styling loads consistently.

= 2.4.0 =
- Added a new front-end Settings workspace inside the `[flexiclub]` portal so authorised managers can work with the existing FlexiClub settings tabs without leaving the front end.
- Reused the shared Branding, Features, Member Menu, Email Settings, Email Templates, Email Logs, and Payment Methods settings flows from Core so front-end saves and redirects stay aligned with the existing wp-admin settings screen.
- Improved front-end settings presentation so Branding spacing, Email Templates actions, and Payment Methods controls use the intended TPW admin-style layout more reliably inside front-end themes.

= 2.3.0 =
- Added a new FlexiClub operations dashboard in wp-admin that brings shared admin screens and front-end bridge launchers together without changing legacy routes.
- Added the new `[flexiclub]` front-end portal dashboard and System Pages workspace so authorised admins can review, validate, repair, unlink, and recreate registered system pages without leaving the front end.
- Fixed System Pages unlink so clearing a page assignment now persists correctly in both wp-admin and front-end workspaces, keeps the underlying WordPress page intact, and returns clearer action feedback.

= 2.2.1 =
- System Pages: clarified the shipped Re-create recovery behaviour so release notes now reflect that recreated pages use the same option-backed registry as registration and lookup, restoring missing registered pages more reliably and returning clearer AJAX errors.

= 2.2.0 =
- System Pages: administrators can now clear stored system page mappings and recreate canonical FlexiClub system pages directly from the settings screen.
- System Pages: page recreation now preserves clearer failure handling for missing slugs, trashed pages, and page-creation errors so recovery is more reliable.

= 2.1.0 =
- Members: standalone FlexiClub sites now treat Members as available by default when the Core members table already exists, so Manage Members and related shared member flows continue to work without requiring an extra consumer toggle.
- Payments: the main Payment Methods settings tab is now hidden by default unless a plugin declares that shared Core payment methods are required, while existing legacy declarations remain supported for backward compatibility.

= 2.0.1 =
- Updates: corrected the public manifest and release download URLs used by the built-in updater so FlexiClub sites check the renamed `tpw-flexiclub` repository and GitHub Pages manifest location correctly.

= 2.0.0 =
- Release delivery: renamed the plugin package, bootstrap file, updater metadata, and public release artifacts from `tpw-core` to `tpw-flexiclub` so the distributed FlexiClub product name, install package, and update manifest now align.
- Menus: theme overrides can now use `theme/tpw-flexiclub/menus/menu-modal.php`, while existing `theme/tpw-core/menus/menu-modal.php` overrides remain supported for backward compatibility.
- Documentation: refreshed installation, branding, developer, and security references so deployment and integration guidance points to the new FlexiClub plugin paths.

= 1.30.0 =
- Branding: the plugin header, admin settings labels, updater metadata, and customer-facing release surfaces now use the FlexiClub product name consistently.
- Email: the default shared email footer branding now shows FlexiClub.
- Documentation: refreshed the public and admin-facing setup copy to describe the shared platform using the FlexiClub name.

= 1.29.0 =
- UI: TPW Core now provides a reusable shared UI enqueue path for the canonical TPW shared styles, making wrapper-based UI integration more consistent across Core screens.
- UI: shared TPW buttons, app navigation, cards, notices, tables, and form styling now apply consistently inside `.tpw-frontend-ui` as well as `.tpw-admin-ui` wrappers.

= 1.28.2 =
- UI: shared admin tab and button selectors now include `.tpw-admin-ui`-scoped counterparts so TPW admin interfaces keep their intended styling in admin wrapper contexts.

= 1.28.1 =
- Payments: Square billing verification now normalizes billing-contact country values to ISO alpha-2 codes before tokenization, maps supported UK variants such as UK, England, and Scotland to GB, and omits invalid free-text values unless a valid configured site-country fallback is available.

= 1.28.0 =
- UI: added a reusable TPW app navigation pattern with primary and secondary variants so shared admin and front-end screens can use button-like workspace and detail tabs from the Core stylesheet.
- UI: app navigation links now suppress theme underline overrides, keep the intended dark secondary-button look for inactive primary tabs, and preserve the accent-filled active state with responsive wrapping and accessible focus handling.

= 1.27.0 =
- Members: added Secretary and Treasurer as compatibility-era office-role fields in Manage Members and grouped the in-scope access and office flags under a new Access & Office Roles section on Add and Edit Member screens.
- Permissions: expanded the TPW Core compatibility read path through `tpw_core_user_can()` so members, payments, and events checks can resolve the new office-role mappings without widening unrelated module migrations.
- Members: protected permission-field enforcement now covers Secretary and Treasurer, Add Member no longer leaves a partial create behind on member-save failure, and linked Administrator edits now keep the linked WordPress user's primary role aligned with the final saved admin state.

= 1.26.1 =
- Members: linked member and WordPress user email addresses now stay synchronized across admin edits, WordPress profile edits, self-service profile email changes, and existing-user CSV imports.
- Members: Edit Member now blocks password setup sends when linked email drift exists, shows the true WordPress recipient address clearly, and reduces synced-state UI noise.

= 1.26.0 =
- Members: [tpw_member_profile] now includes a dedicated Change Password tab where linked members can update their own password from the front end using current-password verification and WordPress-native password handling.
- Members: password change success and error notices now remain scoped to the Change Password tab instead of being carried into sibling profile-tab URLs.

= 1.25.0 =
- Members: CSV member imports now stage password setup recipients only for newly created and linked WordPress users, then present a post-import action to send secure setup emails after the import completes.
- Members: the CSV import results screen now shows password setup eligibility, excluded-row counts, and final sent, failed, skipped, and remaining totals for each import run.
- Members: CSV import password setup sending now runs through a protected batched admin-post flow with transient-backed progress tracking so imports do not send email inline and authorised managers can resume a saved run safely.

= 1.24.0 =
- Members: added an optional password setup email during Add Member so linked WordPress users can receive a secure setup link as soon as the member record is created.
- Members: linked members can now receive a fresh password setup link directly from Edit Member, with dedicated success and failure notices in Manage Members.
- Email: registered a dedicated Member Password Setup email template so the password setup subject and body can be overridden from TPW Core settings.

= 1.23.5 =
- UI: updated the shared light button selector so link elements using `.tpw-btn-light` receive the same light button styling as button elements.

= 1.23.4 =
- Members: corrected front-end member login and password reset handling so quoted and slashed passwords are passed consistently to WordPress during reset and login.
- Members: reset and login notices now survive redirects more reliably, clear stale reset errors after a successful reset, and show a clear password reset success message.
- Members: the member login shortcode now renders separate login, lost-password, and reset-password states so the normal login page no longer includes a competing hidden auth form.

= 1.23.3 =
- TPW Control: moved Upload Pages admin styling out of the section template and into the existing scoped TPW Control stylesheet, keeping the current interface and behaviour unchanged.
- TPW Control: centred the existing TPW Control shell within the viewport using the existing container so the sidebar and content layout stay unchanged.

= 1.23.2 =
- Updates: the WordPress View version details modal now loads its Description and Changelog content from the bundled plugin readme so release notes display properly for GitHub-delivered updates.
- Documentation: refreshed the public plugin description to better explain TPW Core's role within the wider ThePluginWorks plugin ecosystem.

= 1.23.1 =
- Members: fixed a regression where removing the TPW Administrator flag from a linked member could leave the linked WordPress account with the Administrator role.
- Members: member-to-WordPress role synchronization is now enforced centrally during member create and update flows so administrator downgrades are applied consistently.

= 1.23.0 =
- Members: added a dedicated Privacy settings tab to separate visibility and profile-sharing controls from general member settings.
- Members: added a configurable view-only privacy override so selected roles or capabilities can see hidden members without gaining management access.

- Members: admin screens now use the neutral field label while the member profile keeps the fuller explanatory wording.

= 1.22.0 =

- Members: authorised administrators and members managers continue to see all member records in management and oversight views.

= 1.21.2 =
- UI: refined shared primary and secondary TPW button classes so they consistently keep the configured padding, height, and border-radius tokens across shared button usage.

= 1.21.1 =
- UI: refined primary TPW button styling so shared primary button classes consistently keep the configured padding, height, and border radius tokens.

= 1.21.0 =
- UI: added configurable large button size tokens for `.tpw-btn-lg`, including large font size, padding, and height values that are now emitted as shared branding CSS variables.
- UI: reorganised the Branding settings layout so button controls appear with the Buttons section and the scoped UI Theme section now sits after Semantic Notice Colours.

= 1.20.1 =
- UI: refined the shared TPW button stylesheet to provide a clearer outline button variant for primary and secondary buttons.
- Members: refined FlexiGolf activation detection used for conditional visibility in member/admin field flows.

= 1.20.0 =

- Menus: editing a menu item from the menu manager modal now preserves its existing order and structure instead of moving the item to the bottom of the menu.
- Members: FlexiGolf activation detection now recognises TPW FlexiGolf bootstrap markers so Match Managers visibility can be shown reliably when the TPW FlexiGolf plugin is active.

= 1.19.0 =
- Members: TPW Core now stores a canonical membership entitlement on member records for dependent TPW plugins to read consistently.
- Members: membership entitlement support includes a dedicated database column, strict machine-value validation, and code-controlled options rather than loose field configuration.
- Members: the admin Add Member and Edit Member field remains hidden by default and is only exposed when a relevant dependent plugin enables it.

= 1.17.0 =
