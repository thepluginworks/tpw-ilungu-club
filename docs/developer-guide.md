## Shared Framework Hooks Index

Reference for actions and filters provided by the shared plugin framework modules. For usage examples, see the relevant sections below.

## Permissions Compatibility

The shared plugin framework's current plugin-facing permission bridge is:

```php
tpw_core_user_can( string $ability, int $user_id = 0 )
```

Use this helper for TPW capability-style checks instead of querying raw `tpw_members` office-role flags.

For factual office questions, use the narrow office-state predicates:

```php
tpw_core_user_can( 'tpw_member_office_secretary', $user_id )
tpw_core_user_can( 'tpw_member_office_treasurer', $user_id )
```

Each is true only when the linked member row currently has its corresponding flag enabled. They are not authorization capabilities: WordPress Administrator, Core administration, other offices, and broad management permissions do not imply either office. In particular, `tpw_payments_manage` does not answer whether a user is Treasurer. These predicates do not create or synchronise a WordPress role/capability, and existing Secretary or Treasurer records need no migration or backfill. The `tpw_member_office_<office>` pattern is reserved for demonstrated future office-state needs only.

For Noticeboard management authorization, use `tpw_core_user_can( 'tpw_notices_manage', $user_id )`. It mirrors the active Noticeboard rule for WordPress Administrators and linked `is_noticeboard_admin` members; consumers must not read that flag directly.

Current compatibility-era office-role storage:

- `is_secretary`
- `is_treasurer`

These columns currently live in `tpw_members` for compatibility only and are not the long-term plugin contract.

Protected Manage Members permission fields are currently `is_admin`, `is_manage_members`, `is_secretary`, and `is_treasurer`.

`is_admin` remains special because it synchronises with the linked WordPress `administrator` role.

### iLungu Club wp-admin dashboard

The top-level iLungu Club wp-admin dashboard is a shared-framework-owned operational summary screen. Current behaviour is intentionally conservative:

- Dashboard status pills use shared semantic meanings across Club Overview and System Status: `Active`, `Complete`, `Healthy`, and `In use` use the green success tone, `Ready` uses the neutral grey tone, `Needs review` and `Inactive` use the warning tone, and `Missing` or required unavailable states use the error tone.
- Overview card background tints and icon colours express module identity only. They must not override the shared semantic pill colours.
- The `Extend iLungu Club` add-on cards only show real actions. For active catalogue cards, valid consumer `extend_actions` are authoritative per context; otherwise the Core management URL remains the compatibility fallback. Installed inactive plugins may show an activation action, and available plugins may show `Learn more` only when a real product URL exists. Do not add placeholder links, dead buttons, or fake management destinations. See `docs/architecture/ui/tpw-core-club-administration-contribution-contract.md`.
- Compatible active consumer plugins contribute Club Overview cards, active Extend-card actions, and frontend/wp-admin workspaces through `tpw_core_club_administration_contributions`. See `docs/architecture/ui/tpw-core-club-administration-contribution-contract.md`. Quick Actions are Core-owned in this release.

### Email Logging

The shared plugin framework provides a central outbound email dispatcher in `TPW_Email::dispatch_mail()`.
All shared-framework email sends should pass through this method directly, or through helpers such as `TPW_Email::send_email()` and `TPW_Email::send_with_template()` that eventually call the dispatcher.

Immediate send APIs:

- `TPW_Email::dispatch_mail()` remains the immediate low-level API.
- `TPW_Email::send_email()` remains an immediate helper for wrapped HTML sends, attachment validation, and optional sender-copy behaviour.
- `TPW_Email::send_with_template()` remains an immediate helper that resolves a stored template and then sends through `send_email()`.
- These APIs do not create durable queue rows; they send during the current request while still applying shared throttling and logging.

Dispatcher flow:

- Sanitizes the subject and normalizes headers and attachments.
- Applies the shared throttling rules from shared-framework Email Settings.
- Calls WordPress `wp_mail()` during the current request.
- Records a lightweight operational log entry when Email Logging is enabled in shared-framework Email Settings.

Queue behaviour:

- Queue storage table: `{$wpdb->prefix}tpw_email_queue`
- Durable queueing is opt-in through the explicit queue API, not the default behaviour of `TPW_Email::dispatch_mail()`.
- `TPW_Email::enqueue_mail()` is the explicit durable queue API.
- One queued email row schedules one Action Scheduler job through the shared-framework scheduler wrapper once Action Scheduler is fully ready.
- The shared framework distinguishes scheduler availability from scheduler readiness: loaded symbols alone are not treated as a safe scheduling signal.
- If a queue row is created before Action Scheduler reaches `action_scheduler_init`, the row remains `pending` and scheduling is deferred until a safe lifecycle point.
- In that deferred state, `TPW_Email::enqueue_mail()` still returns a successful queue result, but `action_id` may remain `0` until the deferred scheduling pass runs.
- Queued emails are processed asynchronously by Action Scheduler.
- Failed queued sends remain in queue state and are retried with backoff until `max_attempts` is reached.
- WordPress Admin → iLungu Club → Settings → Email Queue is the business-level payload and status view.
- Tools → Scheduled Actions is the infrastructure and job-execution view.
- Email Logs remain an operational attempt log only; they are not the queue store.
- Email Logs are written when an actual send attempt happens, not when a queue row is created.
- Queue rows should only record scheduler diagnostics when scheduling genuinely fails or must wait for scheduler readiness; they should not be treated as send-attempt failures.

Explicit queue API:

Use `TPW_Email::enqueue_mail()` when a caller intentionally wants durable asynchronous delivery.

Choosing immediate vs queued send:

- Use immediate send for user-facing request flows that need an in-request success or failure result, such as contact forms, one-off admin sends, or workflows that must surface delivery failure immediately.
- Use immediate send when the current caller expects the historical `dispatch_mail()` or `send_email()` contract and should not be changed to background delivery silently.
- Use queued send for notifications, reminders, batch-style operational mail, or add-on plugin work that benefits from retry, reconciliation, and background processing.
- Do not switch existing immediate callers to `enqueue_mail()` unless the caller explicitly accepts asynchronous delivery semantics.

Guidance for add-on plugins:

- Add-on plugins such as FlexiSubscriptions should treat `TPW_Email::enqueue_mail()` as the default choice for durable notification workflows that do not need to block the current request.
- Add-on plugins should continue to use the immediate APIs for transactional or interactive flows where the plugin must know whether `wp_mail()` succeeded during the request.
- Queue-safe add-on notifications should pass a clear `context` and `source` label so queue entries and send-attempt logs remain traceable across the shared framework and consumer plugins.
- Add-on plugins should not implement their own parallel durable queue when shared-framework queueing semantics are sufficient.

Optional context:

The dispatcher accepts an optional context argument as either a string or an array.
For logging, the shared framework stores a single context label using `context` when present, otherwise `source` when present.

Example:

```php
TPW_Email::dispatch_mail(
	$to,
	$subject,
	$message,
	$headers,
	[],
	[
		'context' => 'membership-renewal-reminder',
		'source'  => 'My_Module::send_reminder',
	]
);

TPW_Email::enqueue_mail(
	$to,
	$subject,
	$message,
	$headers,
	[],
	[
		'context' => 'membership-renewal-reminder',
		'source'  => 'My_Module::queue_reminder',
	]
);
```

Logged fields:

- `timestamp` — UTC datetime for the dispatch attempt.
- `recipient` — Recipient email address, or a comma-separated list when multiple recipients are passed.
- `subject` — Sanitized subject line.
- `context` — Optional operational label derived from the dispatcher context.
- `status` — `sent` or `failed`.
- `error_message` — Failure detail from WordPress mail handling when available.
- `duration_ms` — Approximate time spent inside the `wp_mail()` call.

Storage:

- Table: `{$wpdb->prefix}tpw_email_logs`
- The shared framework does not store full email bodies in the log table.
- The table is intended for operational troubleshooting only.

Retention:

- The shared framework keeps email logs for 30 days by default.
- A daily scheduled cleanup removes rows older than the retention window.

Admin access:

- WordPress Admin → iLungu Club → Settings → Email Logs
- The screen shows the latest 100 log entries, newest first.
- Administrators can clear the log table from this tab.
- WordPress Admin → iLungu Club → Settings → Email Queue
- The queue tab shows pending, processing, sent, failed, and cancelled items and supports reconciliation, retry, cancel, and sent-item cleanup actions.

Local testing note:

- Local Mailpit verification depends on `wp_mail()` reaching the local mail transport.
- If Site Mailer, SMTP, or similar mail-intercept plugins are active, Mailpit may not receive the message even though the shared framework called `wp_mail()` correctly.
- When validating local delivery, confirm that no mail-routing plugin is overriding the expected local Mailpit path.

---

### Reusable Email Module

The shared plugin framework includes a reusable Email module intended to be shared by features like Members, FlexiGolf, and Candidates. It provides:

- HTML email sending with a simple wrapper and Reply-To headers
- A contact form UI (modal) with TinyMCE-enabled message and attachment support
- Optional “send a copy to me” support

Files:

- `modules/email/class-tpw-email.php` — TPW_Email: sending, validation, and basic logging hooks
- `modules/email/class-tpw-email-form.php` — TPW_Email_Form: renders modal and handles AJAX submission
- `modules/email/templates/email-form.php` — Form layout
- `modules/email/assets/email.js` — TinyMCE init, validation, and AJAX submit
- `modules/email/assets/email.css` — Optional styling

Initialization:

The loader wires the module automatically. No extra setup needed.

Rendering a form:

```php
echo TPW_Email_Form::render([
	'recipient_name'  => $member->first_name . ' ' . $member->surname,
	'recipient_email' => $member->email,
	'from_name'       => $current_user->display_name,
	'from_email'      => $current_user->user_email,
	'plugin_slug'     => 'flexigolf',
	'subject'         => 'Hello from ' . get_bloginfo('name'),
	'message'         => '',
	'send_copy'       => true,
]);
```

On submission, the form posts to the secured `tpw_email_send` AJAX action. The handler validates the request and calls `TPW_Email::send_email()` with sanitized data. Errors are surfaced to the user and success is acknowledged.

If Email Logging is enabled in shared-framework Email Settings, sends routed through these helpers are also recorded in the central email log.

Programmatic send:

```php
$result = TPW_Email::send_email(
	'recipient@example.com',
	[ 'name' => 'Sender Name', 'email' => 'sender@example.com' ],
	'Subject here',
	'<p>Hello world</p>',
	[],            // attachments (validated file paths)
	true           // send copy to sender
);
```

- Max size: 5MB each
- Use `TPW_Email::validate_attachments( $_FILES['attachments'] )` to validate and move uploads to a temp directory; pass resulting file paths to `send_email()`.


- `tpw_email/log` — Action to receive email log details (direction, to/from, subject, attachments, sent). Use to integrate with audit logs.
- `tpw_email/require_login` — Filter to relax or enforce login requirement for sending (default true).

- Nonces (`tpw_email_send`) protect submissions.
- Sanitization is applied to all fields.
- Reply-To is set to the sender; the From header is not forced (to allow SMTP plugins to control it), but you can customize via standard WP filters if needed.




- Verify nonce with `check_ajax_referer( 'your_action_nonce' )` at the top of the handler. For GET-only endpoints, use `check_ajax_referer( 'your_action_nonce', 'nonce' )` to read a named parameter.
- Check permissions before doing anything: use `current_user_can( 'manage_options' )` or a module-specific gate (e.g., TPW_Member_Access flags). Fail fast if unauthorized.
- Sanitize every input. Prefer specific sanitizers:
	- `sanitize_text_field()` for short text
	- `sanitize_email()`, `sanitize_key()`, `absint()` etc. where appropriate
	- `wp_kses_post()` for limited HTML, and `wp_unslash()` when reading from `$_POST`
- Return JSON using the standard helpers only:
	- `wp_send_json_success( $data )` on success
	- `wp_send_json_error( $message_or_data )` on failures

Notes:
- Never echo raw output in AJAX; always terminate with one of the helpers above (they call `wp_die()` for you).
- Document the expected parameters and required capability in code comments near the handler.



## Accessing Payment Settings

The payment-related settings are also stored within the same `flexievent_settings` option. You can access them using:

```php
$settings = get_option( 'flexievent_settings', [] );
$currency_symbol = $settings['currency_symbol'] ?? '£';
$currency_code = $settings['currency_code'] ?? 'GBP';
```

### Payment Settings and Defaults

| Key               | Default Value | Description |
|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| `currency_symbol` | `£`            | Currency symbol used in price displays (e.g., £10.00) |
| `currency_code`   | `GBP`          | ISO 4217 currency code used for integrations or display |


## Shared Framework Email Settings (TPW_Core_Email_Settings)

The shared plugin framework provides a centralised email settings manager that other modules/plugins can consume.

- Storage: WordPress option `tpw_core_email_settings` (array)
- Class: `TPW_Core_Email_Settings`
- Availability: Autoloaded by the shared-framework loader; no extra includes necessary

### Defaults

Key                       | Type  | Default | Notes
------------------------- | ----- | ------- | -----
`enable_throttling`       | bool  | true    | Whether to throttle email sends
`max_emails_per_minute`   | int   | 60      | Throttle ceiling
`delay_between_emails`    | int   | 1       | Seconds delay between sends when throttling
`enable_logging`          | bool  | true    | Enable email activity logging via hooks
`send_test_mode`          | bool  | false   | If enabled, force emails to a test recipient
`test_mode_recipient`     | string| ''      | Email to use in test mode
`default_logo_url`        | string| ''      | Fallback logo URL for email templates

Internally, the class merges saved options with these defaults using `wp_parse_args()`, so missing keys are filled safely.

### Getting settings

```php
// Get a single value
$throttling = TPW_Core_Email_Settings::get( 'enable_throttling' );

// Get the full array (merged with defaults)
$email_settings = TPW_Core_Email_Settings::get();
```

### Updating settings

```php
// Provide only the keys you want to change; they will be merged and validated
$saved = TPW_Core_Email_Settings::update([
]);
```

Notes:
- `update()` performs light validation/coercion (booleans/ints/URLs/sanitization) and merges with existing values and defaults.
- UI wiring will come later; this class only manages storage/logic.


## Email Templating System

The shared plugin framework provides a reusable email templating system so plugins can register templates that site admins can customise (subject/body) and render them with dynamic tokens.

### Registering Templates

Register your templates during `init` by calling:

```php
TPW_Email_Template_Registry::register_template([
	'key'              => 'fixture-confirmation', // required, unique (letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores)
	'group'            => 'flexigolf',            // required, plugin/scope group
	'label'            => 'Fixture Confirmation', // required, admin-facing label
	'default_subject'  => 'Your fixture: {fixture-name} on {fixture-date}', // required
	'default_body'     => '<p>Hi {member-name},</p><p>We look forward to seeing you at {fixture-name} on {fixture-date}.</p>', // required HTML
	'editable_subject' => true,                   // optional (default false)
	'editable_body'    => true,                   // optional (default false)
	'placeholders'     => [                       // optional associative array token => description
		'{fixture-name}' => 'Name of the fixture',
		'{fixture-date}' => 'Date of the fixture',
		'{member-name}'  => 'Name of the member receiving the email',
	],
]);
```

Parameters:
- key (string, required): Unique identifier. Allowed: a–z, 0–9, `_` and `-`.
- group (string, required): Plugin or domain group, e.g., `flexigolf`, `members`, `core`.
- label (string, required): Human-friendly name shown in the admin UI.
- default_subject (string, required): Default subject containing tokens.
- default_body (HTML string, required): Default HTML email body containing tokens.
- editable_subject (bool, optional): If false, subject is not editable in admin.
- editable_body (bool, optional): If false, body is not editable in admin.
- placeholders (array, optional): Map of token => description for admin reference.

Templates are stored in memory only (static registry). Admin overrides are stored in the `wp_`-prefixed `tpw_email_templates` DB table.

#### RSVP plugin — registering templates

To expose RSVP-related templates in wp-admin → iLungu Club → Settings → Email Templates (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=tpw-flexiclub-settings&tab=email-templates`), register them from your RSVP plugin on `init` (or after `tpw_core_loaded`). Use a stable group key for tidy grouping in the UI, e.g. `tpw-rsvp-lodge-meetings`.

Example bootstrap in your RSVP plugin:

```php
add_action( 'init', function() {
	if ( ! class_exists( 'TPW_Email_Template_Registry' ) ) return;

	// Meeting invitation
	TPW_Email_Template_Registry::register_template([
		'key'              => 'rsvp-meeting-invite',
		'group'            => 'tpw-rsvp-lodge-meetings',
		'label'            => 'Meeting Invitation',
		'default_subject'  => 'Invitation: {event-name} on {event-date}',
		'default_body'     => '<p>Hi {member-name},</p><p>You are invited to {event-name} on {event-date} at {event-venue}.</p><p>Please RSVP here: <a href="{rsvp-link}">{rsvp-link}</a></p>',
		'editable_subject' => true,
		'editable_body'    => true,
		'placeholders'     => [
			'{member-name}' => 'Member full name',
			'{event-name}'  => 'Event/meeting title',
			'{event-date}'  => 'Event date (formatted)',
			'{event-venue}' => 'Venue name',
			'{rsvp-link}'   => 'Unique RSVP link for the recipient',
		],
	]);

	// Reminder
	TPW_Email_Template_Registry::register_template([
		'key'              => 'rsvp-reminder',
		'group'            => 'tpw-rsvp-lodge-meetings',
		'label'            => 'RSVP Reminder',
		'default_subject'  => 'Reminder: RSVP for {event-name} ({event-date})',
		'default_body'     => '<p>Hi {member-name},</p><p>This is a reminder to RSVP for {event-name} on {event-date}.</p><p>Respond here: <a href="{rsvp-link}">{rsvp-link}</a></p>',
		'editable_subject' => true,
		'editable_body'    => true,
		'placeholders'     => [
			'{member-name}' => 'Member full name',
			'{event-name}'  => 'Event/meeting title',
			'{event-date}'  => 'Event date (formatted)',
			'{rsvp-link}'   => 'Unique RSVP link for the recipient',
		],
	]);
});
```

Notes:
- If your plugin must run strictly after the shared framework, hook to `tpw_core_loaded` instead of `init`.
- Choose a unique group string to avoid mixing templates from unrelated plugins.
- When sending, use `TPW_Email_Template_Manager::get_rendered_template( 'rsvp-meeting-invite', $tokens )` to merge admin overrides and replace placeholders.
- When moving a group to a canonical identifier, keep the template key stable and declare `legacy_groups` on the canonical registration. Existing overrides remain keyed by template key and are not duplicated or overwritten. See `docs/architecture/tpw-core-canonical-legacy-identity-compatibility-contract.md`.

### Rendering a Template

Use the manager to merge any admin overrides and replace tokens:

```php
$rendered = TPW_Email_Template_Manager::get_rendered_template(
	'fixture-confirmation',
	[
		'{fixture-name}' => 'Oxford v Cambridge',
		'{fixture-date}' => '25 Sept 2025',
	### System Pages Manager

	The active `TPW_Core_System_Pages` registry stores explicit page mappings in the `tpw_core_system_pages` option and ownership markers in page meta; it does not use the retired table-based registry described in earlier guides.

	Key API:
	- `register_page( $slug, [ 'title' => 'My Title', 'shortcode' => '[my_shortcode]', 'plugin' => 'my-addon', 'legacy_plugins' => [ 'legacy-addon' ], 'required' => 1 ] )`
	- `get_page_id( $slug )` / `get_permalink( $slug )`
	- `ensure_page( $slug )`
	- `unlink( $slug )` for an explicit administrator-managed unlink; it does not delete the WordPress page.

	A canonical registration with `legacy_plugins` reuses an existing page carrying the matching legacy ownership marker. It preserves page ID and content, does not create a duplicate page, and may lazily write canonical ownership metadata only when the existing ensure path resolves that page. See `docs/architecture/tpw-core-canonical-legacy-identity-compatibility-contract.md` and `docs/architecture/system-pages/tpw-core-system-page-protection-contract.md`.

		'{member-name}'  => 'Stuart Moodey',
	]
);

// $rendered = [
//   'subject' => 'Your fixture: Oxford v Cambridge on 25 Sept 2025',
//   'body'    => '<p>Hi Stuart Moodey,</p><p>We look forward to seeing you at Oxford v Cambridge on 25 Sept 2025.</p>',
//   'use_logo'=> true,
// ];
```

Notes:
- Token replacement is performed with simple `str_replace()` across both subject and body.
- Tokens that aren’t present in the provided array are left as-is. You may post-process to replace missing values with `N/A` if desired.
- The `use_logo` boolean indicates whether to include the fallback logo for this template when rendering/sending. Honour this in your email wrapper.

### Admin Editing

Under wp-admin → iLungu Club → Settings → Email Templates, site admins can:
- See all registered templates grouped by plugin/scope
- Edit subject/body (only if the template marked them as editable)
- Toggle “Include fallback logo” for that template
- View the list of available placeholders (with descriptions)
- Reset to defaults (removes overrides from the DB)

## Members Admin Form Extension Hooks

You can extend the shared-framework Members module admin forms at:

- `/manage-members/?action=add`
- `/manage-members/?action=edit&id=123`

These hooks let other plugins add custom fields (render) and save their values.

### Render Hook

Action: `tpw_members_admin_form_extra_fields`

Signature:

```php
do_action( 'tpw_members_admin_form_extra_fields', string $context, ?int $member_id, ?object $member, array $meta );
```

Args:
- `$context`: 'add' or 'edit'
- `$member_id`: null on add; member ID on edit
- `$member`: null on add; member object (core fields) on edit
- `$meta`: associative array of all member meta (empty on add)

Where it runs:
- Add form: after the core fields loop and before the submit button
- Edit form: after the core fields loop (and before photos section)

Use standard HTML inputs and ensure your names are unique (e.g., prefix with your plugin slug). If you need file uploads on the Add form, use a custom AJAX endpoint; the Edit form already supports file uploads.

### Save Hook

Action: `tpw_members_admin_form_after_save`

Signature:

```php
do_action( 'tpw_members_admin_form_after_save', string $context, int $member_id );
```

Runs after core fields and meta are saved for both add and edit submissions, allowing you to persist any extra fields you rendered.

## My Profile Tab Extension Hook

Add-on plugins can register new tabs on the front-end My Profile screen by filtering the profile sections registry used by the shared framework.

### Register Hook

Filter: `tpw_core_register_profile_sections`

Signature:

```php
apply_filters( 'tpw_core_register_profile_sections', array $sections )
```

The shared framework treats `profile` as a built-in section and may also register other built-in sections such as `payments`. Add-on plugins should append their own keyed entry and return the full array.

### Supported Section Shape

Each section entry should use this structure:

```php
$sections['policy'] = [
	'slug'       => 'policy',
	'label'      => __( 'My Policies', 'your-plugin' ),
	'icon'       => 'dashicons dashicons-shield-alt',
	'priority'   => 50,
	'callback'   => 'your_plugin_render_policy_section',
	'capability' => 'read',
	'show'       => true,
];
```

Field contract:
- `slug` — optional when it matches the array key; use a unique tab slug.
- `label` — required tab label.
- `icon` — optional icon HTML or CSS classes. Prefer Dashicons class strings when needed.
- `priority` — optional integer sort order; lower values render first.
- `callback` — recommended. A callable that renders the tab content.
- `template` — optional alternative to `callback`; intended for shared-framework-safe template resolution.
- `capability` — optional; section is hidden when the current user lacks the capability.
- `show` — optional boolean; set false to suppress a section.

Invalid sections are skipped safely. If the requested tab slug is unknown, the shared framework falls back to `profile`.

### Callback Contract

Profile section callbacks receive the raw member row object returned from the `tpw_members` table lookup. This is the direct result of `SELECT * FROM {$wpdb->prefix}tpw_members WHERE user_id = %d LIMIT 1`.

Practical guarantees:
- `$member->id` is the TPW member primary key.
- `$member->user_id` is the linked WordPress user ID.
- Other direct properties map to columns on `tpw_members`.
- Member meta is not merged into the object automatically; load it separately when needed.

The shared framework will pass up to three callback arguments depending on what your callable accepts:

```php
function your_plugin_render_policy_section( $member, $section = [], $sections = [] ) {
	if ( ! is_object( $member ) || empty( $member->id ) || empty( $member->user_id ) ) {
		return '<div class="tpw-error">' . esc_html__( 'Member record unavailable.', 'your-plugin' ) . '</div>';
	}

	$member_id = (int) $member->id;
	$user_id   = (int) $member->user_id;

	ob_start();
	echo '<div class="tpw-section">';
	echo '<h2>' . esc_html__( 'My Policies', 'your-plugin' ) . '</h2>';
	echo '<p>' . sprintf( esc_html__( 'Rendering for member #%d (user #%d).', 'your-plugin' ), $member_id, $user_id ) . '</p>';
	echo '</div>';
	return ob_get_clean();
}
```

If your plugin stores additional member-linked values in TPW member meta, load them explicitly using the TPW member ID:

```php
$meta = class_exists( 'TPW_Member_Meta' ) ? TPW_Member_Meta::get_all_meta( (int) $member->id ) : [];
```

### Production Example

Register the section from a front-end-loaded file in your plugin, not an admin-only include:

```php
add_filter( 'tpw_core_register_profile_sections', 'your_plugin_register_policy_profile_tab' );

function your_plugin_register_policy_profile_tab( $sections ) {
	if ( ! is_array( $sections ) ) {
		$sections = [];
	}

	$sections['policy'] = [
		'slug'     => 'policy',
		'label'    => __( 'My Policies', 'your-plugin' ),
		'icon'     => 'dashicons dashicons-shield-alt',
		'priority' => 50,
		'callback' => 'your_plugin_render_policy_section',
		'show'     => true,
	];

	return $sections;
}
```

Recommended placement in an add-on plugin:
- Main plugin bootstrap, or
- a dedicated front-end integration file included by the bootstrap, for example `includes/frontend/class-your-plugin-profile-policy-section.php`

Do not place this integration in an admin-only file, because the My Profile screen is front-end rendered.

## Members module activation and system pages

- To enable the Members module UI from an add-on plugin, define the constant `TPW_MEMBERS_ACTIVE` as true as early as possible in your plugin bootstrap. The shared framework provides a convenience helper:

```php
// Returns true when Members module is active
tpw_members_module_enabled(): bool
```

- System Pages: The shared framework registers the "My Profile" page under slug `my-profile` and shortcode `[tpw_member_profile]`. The shared framework also owns the canonical `manage-members` and `noticeboard` system pages under shortcodes `[tpw_manage_members]` and `[tpw_noticeboard_list]`, and runtime provisioning will reuse existing published slug or shortcode pages before creating new ones. Add-on plugins can ensure the My Profile page exists by calling:

```php
TPW_Core_System_Pages::ensure_page( 'my-profile' );
```

- Add-on owned pages: If an add-on provides its own separate front-end management UI, it should register its own System Page row so the shared framework can manage the linked WP page. Example:

```php
TPW_Core_System_Pages::register_page( 'lodge-members-admin', [
	'title'     => 'Lodge Members Admin',
	'shortcode' => '[tpw_lodge_manage_members]',
	'plugin'    => 'tpw-rsvp-lodge-meetings',
	'required'  => 1,
] );
TPW_Core_System_Pages::ensure_page( 'lodge-members-admin' );
```

- Access control: Use `TPW_Member_Access` helpers to gate UI routes. Only admins or committee should access the Manage Members UI. Do not expose admin actions to regular members.


### Example: Player Home Clubs

Add a small section to capture a member's home clubs (multiple) and save them as user meta.

```php
// In your plugin bootstrap, e.g. on init or plugins_loaded
add_action( 'tpw_members_admin_form_extra_fields', function( $context, $member_id, $member, $meta ) {
	// Read existing values on edit; none on add
	$clubs = [];
	if ( $context === 'edit' && $member_id && $member && ! empty($member->user_id) ) {
		$clubs = (array) get_user_meta( (int) $member->user_id, 'tpw_home_clubs', true );
		if ( empty($clubs) ) $clubs = [];
	}
	?>
	<fieldset class="tpw-fieldset">
		<legend>Player Home Clubs</legend>
		<div id="tpw-home-clubs">
			<?php
			$values = !empty($clubs) ? $clubs : [''];
			foreach ( $values as $idx => $val ) {
				echo '<div class="tpw-inline-input-action" style="margin-bottom:6px;">';
				echo '<input type="text" name="tpw_home_clubs[]" value="' . esc_attr( $val ) . '" placeholder="e.g., Royal Liverpool GC" />';
				echo '</div>';
			}
			?>
		</div>
		<p class="description">Add one or more clubs (free text). Duplicate and empty values will be filtered on save.</p>
		<button type="button" class="button" onclick="(function(btn){ var c=document.getElementById('tpw-home-clubs'); var d=document.createElement('div'); d.className='tpw-inline-input-action'; d.style.marginBottom='6px'; d.innerHTML='<input type=\'text\' name=\'tpw_home_clubs[]\' placeholder=\'e.g., Royal Liverpool GC\' />'; c.appendChild(d); })(this)">Add another club</button>
	</fieldset>
	<?php
}, 10, 4 );

add_action( 'tpw_members_admin_form_after_save', function( $context, $member_id ) {
	// Persist as user meta, deduplicate and sanitize
	$controller = new TPW_Member_Controller();
	$member = $controller->get_member( (int) $member_id );
	if ( ! $member || empty($member->user_id) ) return;

	$clubs = isset($_POST['tpw_home_clubs']) && is_array($_POST['tpw_home_clubs']) ? $_POST['tpw_home_clubs'] : [];
	$clubs = array_map( 'sanitize_text_field', array_filter( array_map( 'trim', $clubs ) ) );
	$clubs = array_values( array_unique( $clubs ) );

	update_user_meta( (int) $member->user_id, 'tpw_home_clubs', $clubs );
}, 10, 2 );
```

Notes:
- If you need to store data in the TPW member meta table instead, use `TPW_Member_Meta::save_meta( $member_id, 'your_key', $value )` in the save hook.
- For complex UIs, you can enqueue your own admin JS/CSS on the manage-members page using standard WP enqueue hooks and checking `is_page('manage-members')`.


## Manage Members — Buttons Extension Hooks

On `/manage-members/`, the top toolbar groups actions into two sections with buttons: Admin (left) and Tools (right). You can append your own buttons to either group using these actions:

### Hooks

- `tpw_members_admin_buttons_end` — Fires at the end of the Admin button group. Use to add admin actions like “Bulk Invite”, “Sync from CRM”, etc.
- `tpw_members_tools_buttons_end` — Fires at the end of the Tools button group. Use to add utilities like exports, reports, or settings shortcuts.

Both hooks receive a single `$context` array with useful values:

Key                | Type   | Description
------------------ | ------ | -----------
`page_url`         | string | Permalink URL for the Manage Members page
`export_url`       | string | Only for Tools hook; pre-built Export CSV URL reflecting current filters
`current_view`     | string | `list` or `card`
`selected_status`  | string | Current status filter value (may be empty)
`search`           | string | Current text search
`per_page`         | int    | Current per-page value
`is_admin`         | bool   | True when the current user has admin rights in this module

### Examples

Append a new Admin button that navigates to a custom action on the same page:

```php
add_action( 'tpw_members_admin_buttons_end', function( array $ctx ) {
	// Build a URL on the same page: /manage-members/?action=bulk_invite
	$url = add_query_arg( 'action', 'bulk_invite', $ctx['page_url'] );
	echo '<a class="tpw-btn tpw-btn-secondary" href="' . esc_url( $url ) . '" role="button">Bulk Invite</a>';
});
```

Append a Tools button that opens a custom report:

```php
add_action( 'tpw_members_tools_buttons_end', function( array $ctx ) {
	$url = admin_url( 'admin.php?page=my-report&from=members' );
	echo '<a class="tpw-btn tpw-btn-light" href="' . esc_url( $url ) . '" role="button">Member Report</a>';
});
```

### Styling guidance

Use the existing button classes for visual consistency:

- `tpw-btn tpw-btn-primary` — Primary call to action
- `tpw-btn tpw-btn-secondary` — Secondary action
- `tpw-btn tpw-btn-light` — Tertiary/light button
- `tpw-btn tpw-btn-admin` — Admin/settings emphasis

Buttons are inline within a flex container, so keep labels short. Use `role="button"` on links for accessibility parity with buttons.


## WordPress Roles and Member Access

Imported members are created with no WordPress role (wp_capabilities = none). This is intentional.

- WordPress roles are not used for access control in the shared plugin framework or FlexiGolf.
- Members with no role can still log in to WordPress.
- Front-end access (e.g., FlexiGolf screens) is determined by `tpw_members` table values such as `status` (Active, Honorary, Life Member).
- Leaving role = none prevents unwanted backend access while still allowing front-end login.
- Do not assign default roles (e.g., Subscriber) unless there is a specific need to grant WordPress dashboard access.

This ensures that login and permissions remain managed entirely by the shared framework and related plugins, not by native WordPress roles.


## Address Lookup

The shared-framework address lookup helper supports two modes:

- basic: Returns normalized address metadata for the requested postcode using the active provider.
- full: Returns a list of normalized address options when the active provider supports full address lists.

Settings

- Stored under `tpw_postcode_settings` with `provider` set to one of `none`, `ideal_postcodes`, or `fetchify`.
- The shared framework normalizes removed legacy provider values back to `none`.
- The shared runtime also exposes whether lookup is enabled at all and whether full address lists are available for the active provider.

Server API

- AJAX action: `tpw_lookup_postcode`
- Params:
	- `postcode` (string, required)
	- `country` (string, optional, default `GB`)
	- `mode` (string, `basic`|`full`, optional, default `basic`)
	- `street_prefix` (string, optional, used to filter addresses starting with a number prefix)
- Behavior:
	- If lookup is disabled or the selected provider is scaffolded-only, the shared framework returns a clear non-fatal message and forms remain in manual-entry mode.
	- Ideal Postcodes is wired for live GB address lookup and returns a shared `addresses` array shape when `mode=full`.

Frontend behavior

- When the user clicks "Lookup" with a postcode and live lookup is enabled:
	- A "Select Address" dropdown is shown when the provider returns multiple address options.
	- On selection, the following fields are populated when present: `address1`, `address2`, `town`, `county`, `postcode`, and `country`.
- When lookup is disabled, the shared framework does not render the lookup button, helper messages, or address selector markup.
- The postcode input remains editable and changing it hides the dropdown and clears any inline warning.

Provider status

- `none`: manual address entry only.
- `ideal_postcodes`: fully wired for live GB address lookup when configured.
- `fetchify`: settings scaffold only in this shared-framework release; lookup UI stays hidden.

Notes

- Manual address entry remains the first-class fallback for all shared-framework forms.

## TPW Control (Front-end Admin Hub)

TPW Control centralizes front‑end admin tools behind a single shortcode and routed sub‑pages.
iLungu Club now also exposes FE-first workspace shells for the same operational areas so the old Control hub can remain as a compatibility layer instead of the only entry point.

- Shortcode: `[tpw-control]`
- Route format: `/tpw-control/?action=` where `action` matches a registered section key.
- Default page (no `action`): Dashboard.
- FE workspace shortcodes: `[flexiclub]`, `[flexiclub_menu_management]`, and `[flexiclub_archival_system]`.
- FE system page slugs: `flexiclub`, `menu-management`, and `archival-system`.
- Legacy compatibility: keep the `tpw-control` page registered and available during migration; do not hard-remove existing links, pages, or shortcode usage.

Conventions
- Front‑end only for now; architected for an optional future wp‑admin UI.
- Permissions leverage Members module flags and statuses (no `is_member` flag).
- Sections can be added by other plugins via filter and action hooks.

Autocreate Control and FE Workspace Pages
- The shared framework should register and safely ensure the canonical FE portal pages `flexiclub`, `menu-management`, and `archival-system` using their dedicated shortcodes.
- The shared framework should also keep the legacy `tpw-control` page registered and available on activation when it is missing, but treat it as a transition workspace rather than the primary long-term entry point.
- Use duplicate-safe creation checks so existing slug pages or shortcode pages are preserved instead of being recreated.

Sections Registry
Use the `tpw_control/sections` filter to register or modify sections. Each section is an associative array with:

```
[
	'key'        => 'my-section',         // unique id (also used in ?action=)
	'label'      => 'My Section',         // sidebar label
	'capability' => '__tpw_control_is_admin__', // see capability markers below
	'callback'   => [ $class, 'render' ], // callable to render content
	'position'   => 30,                   // sort order in sidebar
	'icon'       => 'dashicons-admin-generic' // optional Dashicons class or URL
]
```

Capability markers understood by TPW Control:
- `__tpw_control_is_member__` — current user is a valid member per `TPW_Member_Access::is_member_current()`
- `__tpw_control_is_admin__` — current user is an admin per `TPW_Member_Access::is_admin_current()`
- `__tpw_control_is_committee_or_admin__` — member with committee flag or admin

Alternatively, set `capability` to a callable `(array $section) => bool`, a WordPress capability string, `true` (any logged‑in user), or `false` (public).

Router and Hooks
- All rendering goes through `TPW_Control_Router` which reads `?action=` and dispatches.
- Hooks:
	- `tpw_control/register_sections` — fire early to let plugins prepare section definitions.
	- `tpw_control_register_sections` (filter) — preferred filter to add/modify sections (new in Phase 5). Back-compat: `tpw_control/sections` still runs after this.
	- `tpw_control_can_manage` (filter) — global gate for accessing the TPW Control hub; defaults to admins only. Return true to allow more roles.
	- `tpw_control/sidebar_after_menu` — append content below the menu list.
	- `tpw_control/render_upload_pages` — output Upload Pages UI into the Upload Pages section.
	- `tpw_control/upload_pages_shortcode` (filter) — return a shortcode string to be rendered inside the Upload Pages section.
	- `tpw_control/render_menu_manager` — output the front‑end WP Menu Manager UI.
	- `tpw_control_render_section_{slug}` — action fired when a section with key `{slug}` does not provide a callable `callback`. Use this to render fully external sections (new in Phase 5).

Templates
- Layout: `modules/tpw-control/templates/layout.php` (sidebar + content).
- Dashboard: `modules/tpw-control/templates/dashboard.php`.
- Sections: `modules/tpw-control/templates/sections/*.php`.

Assets
- CSS: `modules/tpw-control/assets/css/tpw-control.css`
- JS: `modules/tpw-control/assets/js/tpw-control.js`
- FE workspace wrapper CSS: `assets/css/flexiclub-dashboard.css`
- TPW Control assets may be enqueued from FE workspace shells via `TPW_Control::enqueue_workspace_assets()` when the legacy sections are embedded inside the iLungu Club portal.

Shortcode Routing
- The shortcode renders the layout and content for the section indicated by `?action=`.
- Example URLs after you place the shortcode on a page:
	- `https://example.com/tpw-control/?action=upload-pages`
	- `https://example.com/tpw-control/?action=menu-manager`

iLungu Club FE Workspace Routing
- `[flexiclub]` remains the main iLungu Club FE portal and can route to additive workspace views such as `?workspace=menu-management` and `?workspace=archival-system`.
- `[flexiclub_menu_management]` and `[flexiclub_archival_system]` render the same FE shell directly on dedicated system pages.
- When reusing TPW Control sections inside iLungu Club FE workspaces, preserve the original section callbacks and legacy routes rather than duplicating their business logic.

### Developer helpers (Phase 5)

- `tpw_control_section_url( $slug )` — returns a URL to the current page with `?action=$slug` appended, e.g., `/tpw-control/?action=upload-pages`.
- `tpw_control_user_has_access( $visibility, $member = null )` — evaluates a Visibility JSON object/array for the current user (or a provided `$member`). Admins always pass. See Visibility JSON spec below.

### Adding external sections (Phase 5)

1) Register your section using the filter:

```php
add_filter( 'tpw_control_register_sections', function( array $sections ) {
	$sections['fixtures'] = [
		'key'        => 'fixtures',
		'label'      => 'Fixtures',
		'visibility' => [ 'logged_in' => true, 'flags_any' => ['is_admin','is_committee'] ],
		// No callback provided → router will fire tpw_control_render_section_fixtures
		'position'   => 40,
		'icon'       => 'dashicons-calendar-alt',
	];
	return $sections;
});
```

2) Render via the dynamic action:

```php
add_action( 'tpw_control_render_section_fixtures', function( array $section ) {
	echo '<h2>Fixtures</h2>';
	// Output your UI here; honour nonces/POST handling and use tpw_control_section_url('fixtures') for links.
});
```

Notes:
- Admins are always allowed; otherwise `visibility` is checked via `tpw_control_user_has_access()`.
- You can still use the legacy `tpw_control/sections` filter; it runs after `tpw_control_register_sections`.

### Upload Pages — Section spec

Purpose
- Front-end tool for creating simple “Upload Pages” that display downloadable files grouped by year.

UI fields
- Page
	- Title (string, required)
	- Slug (string, required, unique)
	- Description (string, optional)
	- Visibility (JSON, optional; defaults to admin-only)
- Files Manager
	- Upload files (multiple)
	- Year (int/string, optional, saved per file)
	- Label (string, optional, saved per file)
	- Reorder (drag/sort preserves `sort_order`)
	- Delete file

Routing
- List: `/tpw-control/?action=upload-pages`
- Edit: `/tpw-control/?action=upload-pages&sub=edit&upload_page_id=<id>`

Linked WordPress Page
- Each Upload Page automatically creates a corresponding WordPress Page when created.
- Content of the WordPress Page is a shortcode: `[tpw_upload_page slug="<upload-page-slug>"]`.
- The WordPress Page title and shortcode are kept in sync when the Upload Page is renamed; the permalink/slug of the WordPress Page is not changed to avoid breaking external links.
- Deleting an Upload Page moves the linked WordPress Page to the Trash.
- If the linked Page is deleted manually, the Upload Page edit screen shows a “Recreate Page” button to re‑generate it.

Public Shortcode
- `[tpw_upload_page slug="..."]` renders the Upload Page on a normal WordPress Page or post. Internally this calls `TPW_Control_Upload_Pages::render_page_public( $slug )` and applies the Upload Page’s visibility rules.

Lightbox behavior
- Each file renders a single preview link (`.tpw-upl-preview`) that wraps the icon and label. This prevents duplicate anchors with the same `data-index`.
- The built-in lightbox scopes navigation to the clicked Upload Page instance and resolves items by `data-index`. If you render multiple Upload Pages on one screen, navigation will stay within the clicked instance.

Visibility JSON (supported keys)
- `public` (bool): true allows all visitors (logged out users included)
- `logged_in` (bool): require a logged-in user
- `flags_any` (array<string>): any of `is_admin`, `is_committee`, `is_match_manager`, `is_noticeboard_admin`, `is_gallery_admin`
- `flags_all` (array<string>): user must have all listed flags
- `flags_not` (array<string>): user must NOT have any listed flags
- `allowed_statuses` (array<string>): member statuses allowed (e.g., `Active`, `Honorary`)

Rules
- Admins always allowed.
- If `public` is true, access is granted immediately.
- If `logged_in` is true and user is not logged in, access is denied.
- Flags and statuses are evaluated only when a member record is present; if required but unavailable, access is denied.
- With no visibility specified, default behavior requires a valid TPW member (same as `__tpw_control_is_member__`).

Data model (internal)
- Pages table stores Title, Slug, Description, Visibility (JSON), created/updated timestamps.
- Files table stores Attachment ID, Label, Year, Sort order; displayed grouped by Year.

### Menu Manager — Section spec

Purpose
- Front-end UI to manage WordPress nav menus without wp-admin, with TPW Control-aware links and per-item visibility.

Capabilities
- Create/select a WordPress menu
- Add links:
	- TPW Control sections (registered via filters)
	- Upload Pages (from Upload Pages section)
	- Custom links (URL + label)
- Edit existing menu items (label, URL) and delete items
- Per-item metadata:
	- `_tpw_visibility_json` (LONGTEXT): Visibility JSON as above; used to filter items on front-end
	- `_tpw_requires_login` (bool): If true, item is hidden from logged-out visitors

Routing
- `/tpw-control/?action=menu-manager[&menu_id=<id>]`

Notes
- All forms/actions are nonce-protected.
- Admin-only by default. Visibility logic for item meta mirrors `tpw_control_user_has_access()`.
- Theme integration: A front-end filter/walker can use `_tpw_visibility_json` and `_tpw_requires_login` to hide items the current user shouldn’t see.
