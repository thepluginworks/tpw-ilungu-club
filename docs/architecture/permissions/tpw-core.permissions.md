# Shared Plugin Framework – Permissions Specification

**Status:** Authoritative  
**Applies to:** the shared plugin framework (Members, Payments, Gallery, Menus, Notices, TPW Control)
**Audience:** Developers (VC), Maintainers, QA  
**Do not deviate from this document when implementing permissions.**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **permission model for the shared plugin framework**.

The shared framework provides infrastructure used by all TPW plugins.
It establishes:
- the **canonical role definitions** (club-facing roles)
- the **capability contract** used by all code
- the rules for mapping **club office roles → capabilities**
- non-negotiable safety and compatibility guarantees

All TPW plugins **must rely on these definitions** and must not invent their own permission logic.

---

## 2. Core Principles (Non‑Negotiable)

1. **Capabilities are the contract**
   - Plugin-facing TPW permission checks in code MUST use:
     ```
     tpw_core_user_can( 'tpw_xxx', $user_id )
     ```
   - For current-user checks, omit `$user_id` or pass `0`.
   - Code MUST NOT check WordPress role slugs, TPW member flags, or group labels directly.

2. **Office roles are club facts**
   - Secretary, Treasurer, Committee, Match Manager, etc. are club facts.
   - Secretary and Treasurer currently live in `tpw_members` as compatibility-era storage columns (`is_secretary`, `is_treasurer`).
   - Raw storage is not the long-term plugin contract.
   - They do NOT imply WordPress Administrator access.

3. **WordPress Administrator is a permanent override**
   - Existing WP Administrators are never demoted.
   - WP Administrators implicitly have all TPW capabilities.

4. **No silent behaviour changes**
   - Any tightening of permissions must be gated and testable.
   - Legacy behaviour must remain functional until explicitly changed.

### Phase 1 Core Compatibility Mapping

The current shared-framework compatibility layer exposes these office-role aligned checks:

- `tpw_members_manage` = WordPress Administrator / `is_admin` / `is_manage_members` / `is_secretary`
- `tpw_payments_manage` = WordPress Administrator / `is_admin` / `is_treasurer`
- `tpw_events_manage` = WordPress Administrator / `is_admin` / `is_secretary`

Manage Members protected fields in this phase are:

- `is_admin`
- `is_manage_members`
- `is_secretary`
- `is_treasurer`

`is_admin` remains special because it synchronises with the linked WordPress `administrator` role.

### Office-State Predicates

Office-state predicates answer a factual question about the linked Club member record. They are not authorization capabilities and do not grant access to an action.

The currently supported predicates are:

```php
tpw_core_user_can( 'tpw_member_office_secretary', $user_id )
tpw_core_user_can( 'tpw_member_office_treasurer', $user_id )
```

Each returns true only when `$user_id` resolves to a linked `tpw_members` record with its corresponding office flag enabled (`is_secretary` or `is_treasurer`). WordPress Administrator status, Core administration, Members Manager status, Committee status, and broad management abilities do not imply either office. In particular, `tpw_payments_manage` answers whether a user may manage payments; it does not answer whether that user is Treasurer.

This predicate creates no WordPress role or capability, does not synchronise the member flag to WordPress, and requires no migration or backfill. The `tpw_member_office_<office>` namespace is reserved for demonstrated consumer needs only; it must not be populated speculatively.

---

## 3. Platform Roles (Business Roles)

These are **club-facing roles**, not capabilities.

- WordPress Administrator
- Secretary
- Treasurer
- Membership Admin
- Events Manager
- Committee Member
- Match Manager
- Fixtures / Results Editor
- Noticeboard Editor
- Auditor (read-only)

These roles are mapped to capabilities by shared-framework logic.
Plugins must never infer behaviour directly from these role names.

---

## 4. Capability Naming Rules

All shared-framework capabilities follow this pattern:

```
tpw_<module>_<area>_<verb>
```

Rules:
- Lowercase
- Underscore separated
- Explicit scope (view vs manage, own vs all)
- No role names in capability strings

These naming rules apply to authorization capabilities. Office-state predicates use the separately reserved `tpw_member_office_<office>` pattern and are factual checks, not action permissions.

---

## 5. Capability Register – Shared Plugin Framework

### 5.1 Members

Used for managing the club’s member register and role flags.

- `tpw_members_view`
- `tpw_members_manage`
- `tpw_members_create`
- `tpw_members_import`
- `tpw_members_status_manage`
- `tpw_members_roles_manage`
- `tpw_members_userlink_manage`

Notes:
- Subscriptions onboarding does **not** require member creation.
- Treasurer may be granted `tpw_members_manage` temporarily for migrations, then removed.
- Plugins must call `tpw_core_user_can()` instead of reading raw member flags.

---

### 5.2 Payments (runtime payments & logs)

Used by Subscriptions, RSVP, Ticketing, etc.

- `tpw_payments_view`
- `tpw_payments_manage`
- `tpw_payments_refund_manage`
- `tpw_payments_export`

---

### 5.3 Payment Methods / Gateways (configuration)

High‑risk system configuration.

- `tpw_payments_methods_view`
- `tpw_payments_methods_manage`

Default intent:
- WP Admin: manage
- Secretary: club choice
- Treasurer: view only (unless explicitly granted)

---

### 5.4 Gallery

Supports scoped gallery admins.

- `tpw_gallery_view`
- `tpw_gallery_upload`
- `tpw_gallery_manage_own`
- `tpw_gallery_manage_all`
- `tpw_gallery_settings_manage`

Rules:
- “Own” vs “All” must be enforced.
- Gallery Admins must never gain access outside assigned galleries.

---

### 5.5 Menus (meal choices library)

Shared infrastructure for RSVP and Ticketing.

- `tpw_menus_view`
- `tpw_menus_manage`

---

### 5.6 Notices / Noticeboard

- `tpw_notices_view`
- `tpw_notices_manage`

Used by Noticeboard Editor role.

`tpw_notices_manage` mirrors the active Noticeboard management rule: WordPress Administrators and linked members with `is_noticeboard_admin = 1` may manage notices. Consumers must use this ability rather than reading the member flag directly.

---

### 5.7 TPW Control – Website Menu Visibility

Controls who sees which front‑end menu items.

- `tpw_control_menu_view`
- `tpw_control_menu_manage`

High‑impact capability.  
Usually restricted to Secretary / WP Admin.

---

### 5.8 TPW Control – Archive / File Upload System

- `tpw_control_archive_view`
- `tpw_control_archive_upload`
- `tpw_control_archive_manage`
- `tpw_control_archive_settings_manage`

---

## 6. Match Manager (Special Case – Do Not Break)

Match Manager permissions are **not** a single capability.

They are enforced by **three layers**:

1. **Role flag**
   - Member is flagged as Match Manager in TPW Members.

2. **Ownership**
   - Match Manager may only edit fixtures assigned to them.

3. **Field‑level policy**
   - Admin‑configured “Match Manager Control” settings restrict editable fields.

This model must be preserved exactly.  
Capabilities must not flatten this into “manage all”.

---

## 7. Public Access (Explicit Non‑Capability)

“Public” is **not** a capability.

Public visibility is handled by:
- TPW Access Control
- Page visibility rules
- Shortcode logic

Logged‑out users do not possess capabilities.

---

## 8. Backwards Compatibility Rules

- Existing WordPress Administrators must remain Administrators.
- Existing front‑end access must not be broken.
- Legacy checks may exist internally but must map to capabilities.
- No plugin may assume another plugin’s permission helpers.

---

## 9. Testing Requirements

Every permission change must be tested against:

- WordPress Administrator
- Secretary
- Treasurer
- Membership Admin
- Committee Member
- Match Manager
- Fixtures / Results Editor
- Noticeboard Editor
- Auditor
- Standard Member
- Logged‑out visitor

Special regression focus:
- Match Manager editing own vs others’ fixtures
- Gallery Admin own vs all galleries
- Archive uploads vs deletes
- Menu visibility changes

---

## 10. Enforcement for VC

When implementing or modifying the shared framework:

- ❌ Do NOT check WP role slugs
- ❌ Do NOT check TPW member flags directly in plugins
- ❌ Do NOT invent new capability names
- ✅ Use only capabilities listed in this file
- ✅ Treat this document as the single source of truth

Any deviation requires an explicit update to this document first.
