# TPW Platform – Default Role ↔ Capability Matrix

**Status:** Authoritative (Human‑readable reference)  
**Location:** Shared plugin framework (single source of truth)
**Audience:** Product, Sales, QA, Developers (VC)  

This document defines the **default capability mapping** for TPW platform roles.

It is:
- a **reference and testing guide**
- a **sales/onboarding explanation**
- the canonical place to understand “who can do what”

It is **not executable code**.

All plugins must enforce permissions using their own
`tpw-<plugin>.permissions.md` specification files.  
This matrix explains the *default intent*.

## 1. Shared Framework Principles

1. **WordPress Administrator is absolute**
   - Existing WP Administrators are never demoted.
   - WP Admin implicitly has all TPW capabilities.

2. **Capabilities, not roles, are enforced**
   - Plugin-facing TPW checks use `tpw_core_user_can( 'tpw_xxx', $user_id )`.
   - Roles map to capabilities via shared-framework logic.

Current Phase 1 shared-framework note:
- Secretary and Treasurer remain compatibility-era storage in `tpw_members`; plugins must not query raw flags directly.

### Office-State Predicates

The matrix describes broad authorization capabilities; it does not establish factual office holding. A consumer that needs to know whether a linked Club member currently holds the Secretary office must use:

```php
tpw_core_user_can( 'tpw_member_office_secretary', $user_id )
tpw_core_user_can( 'tpw_member_office_treasurer', $user_id )
```

These narrow office-state predicates are true only when the linked member row has the corresponding office flag enabled. WordPress Administrator status and broad member, event, or payment-management permissions do not imply either office. In particular, `tpw_payments_manage` does not imply Treasurer. They create no WordPress role or capability and need no migration or backfill. `tpw_member_office_<office>` is reserved for demonstrated future needs, rather than a speculative mirror of Club flags.

3. **Defaults are adjustable**
   - Clubs may grant or revoke capabilities (e.g. give Treasurer temporary member-import access).
   - This matrix shows *recommended defaults*, not hard limits.

4. **Read-only roles exist**
   - Auditor and Committee are intentionally limited.

## 9. Usage Notes (Important)

- Clubs may **temporarily grant** additional capabilities (e.g. Treasurer importing members).
- Removal of a capability must immediately restrict access.
- Access Control determines **visibility**, not authority.
- This matrix must be used for:
  - QA testing
  - onboarding discussions
  - sales expectations

---

## 10. Change Control

Any change to default permissions requires:
1. Updating this matrix
2. Updating the relevant plugin permissions spec
3. Regression testing against production roles
