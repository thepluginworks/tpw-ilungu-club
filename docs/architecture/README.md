# TPW Platform Architecture

This section contains the architecture documentation for the shared plugin framework and the wider TPW platform.

The shared plugin framework is the shared foundation of the TPW plugin ecosystem. The architecture documentation is organised into separate domains so platform rules can be defined clearly and maintained independently as the system evolves.

## Identity Architecture

Identity architecture defines who a person is in the platform and how identity is derived from shared-framework data.

Identity determines who a person is.

The canonical identity specification is [docs/architecture/identity/identity-model.md](identity/identity-model.md).

The canonical role classification reference is [docs/architecture/identity/role-classification-model.md](identity/role-classification-model.md).

The audit-backed identity and permissions decision pack is [docs/architecture/identity/identity-permissions-decisions.md](identity/identity-permissions-decisions.md).

The Phase 2C member-flag ownership reference is [docs/architecture/identity/member-flag-ownership-model.md](identity/member-flag-ownership-model.md).

The phased implementation roadmap is [docs/architecture/identity/identity-permissions-implementation-roadmap.md](identity/identity-permissions-implementation-roadmap.md).

## Permissions Architecture

Permissions architecture defines capabilities, permission roles, and how authority is enforced across plugins.

Permissions determine what a person can do.

The canonical permissions specification is [docs/architecture/permissions/tpw-core.permissions.md](permissions/tpw-core.permissions.md).

Supporting permissions architecture references include:

- [docs/architecture/permissions/role-capability-matrix.md](permissions/role-capability-matrix.md)
- [docs/architecture/permissions/vc-permissions-implementation-playbook.md](permissions/vc-permissions-implementation-playbook.md)

## System Page Protection Architecture

System page protection architecture defines how the shared framework identifies private iLungu Club pages, hides them from logged-out automatic page listings, and delegates direct access enforcement to the owning route or shortcode.

The canonical system page protection contract is [docs/architecture/system-pages/tpw-core-system-page-protection-contract.md](system-pages/tpw-core-system-page-protection-contract.md).

## Navigation Architecture

Navigation architecture defines how the shared framework manages shared menu surfaces such as the iLungu Club Members Menu and how add-on plugins contribute managed items safely.

The canonical Members Menu registration contract is [docs/architecture/navigation/tpw-core-members-menu-registration-contract.md](navigation/tpw-core-members-menu-registration-contract.md).

## UI Architecture

UI architecture defines the canonical wrapper, shared component, and enqueue contract for the shared framework and consumer plugins.

The canonical shared UI contract is [docs/architecture/ui/tpw-core-ui-wrapper-enqueue-contract.md](ui/tpw-core-ui-wrapper-enqueue-contract.md).

The canonical Club Management dashboard, workspace, and wp-admin consumer contribution contract is [docs/architecture/ui/tpw-core-club-administration-contribution-contract.md](ui/tpw-core-club-administration-contribution-contract.md).

## Payments Architecture

Payments architecture defines the distinction between stored active preferences and customer-safe checkout methods.

The canonical payment-method contract is [docs/architecture/payments/tpw-core-payment-method-contract.md](payments/tpw-core-payment-method-contract.md).

## Architectural Separation

Identity and permissions are separate architectural layers.

- Identity determines who a person is.
- Permissions determine what a person can do.
- UI architecture determines how shared TPW screens, wrappers, and shared UI assets are integrated safely.

They are related, but they are not the same concern and should be documented separately.
