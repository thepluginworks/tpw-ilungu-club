# Shared Plugin Framework – Members Menu Registration Contract

**Status:** Authoritative  
**Applies to:** The shared-framework-managed iLungu™ Club Members Menu and add-on plugins that contribute managed member-facing items
**Audience:** Developers, Maintainers, QA

## 1. Purpose

This contract defines how the shared plugin framework and add-on plugins register managed items into the iLungu Club Members Menu without writing nav-menu items directly.

The Members Menu is a shared-framework-managed menu surface. Add-on plugins must contribute item specifications through the shared-framework registration filter so seeding, repair, visibility, duplicate prevention, and provider lifecycle stay consistent.

## 2. Ownership Model

The iLungu Club Members Menu is managed by the shared plugin framework.

That means:

- The shared framework seeds and repairs the menu items
- The shared framework stores the item metadata used for duplicate prevention and visibility
- The shared framework evaluates managed Members Menu visibility on the front end
- add-ons register item specifications through the shared-framework filter
- add-ons must not call `wp_update_nav_menu_item()` directly for managed Members Menu entries
- add-ons must not filter `wp_nav_menu_objects` to hide or show their own managed Members Menu items

Site-owned custom menu items may still exist in the same menu, but the shared framework must not rewrite or delete those custom items.

## 3. Registration Hook

Add-ons register managed Members Menu items through:

- `tpw_core/member_menu_items`

Current implementation file:

- `includes/tpw-core-settings.php`

Filter signature:

```php
apply_filters( 'tpw_core/member_menu_items', $items, $context )
```

Where:

- `$items` is the current ordered list of managed item specs, including shared-framework defaults
- `$context` is an array of shared registration context values, currently including `allowed_statuses`

Shared-framework defaults are registered through the same path before the filter runs.

## 4. Item Specification

Managed Members Menu items use the following contract fields.

### 4.1 Required fields

- `key` — unique managed item key. Add-ons must namespace this by provider, for example `flexievent-events`
- `provider` — plugin/provider key, for example `flexievent`
- `title` — visible menu label
- `requires_login` — whether the item should be hidden from logged-out users
- `visibility` — shared-framework visibility rules for the menu item

### 4.1.1 Canonical and legacy migration fields

- `legacy_keys` — optional previous managed item key(s) that resolve to this canonical `key`
- `legacy_providers` — optional prior provider identifier(s), retained as registration metadata during a provider migration

When a consumer temporarily contributes canonical and legacy forms, the canonical form must declare its legacy keys. Core renders one logical menu item, gives the canonical form priority, and retains legacy keys for matching existing managed menu metadata during repair. Existing menu rows are updated to the canonical key/provider only when normal repair already processes that item; Core does not bulk rewrite menu rows.

### 4.2 Preferred destination field

- `system_slug` — preferred canonical destination when the plugin owns a real front-end page registered through `TPW_Core_System_Pages`

### 4.3 Optional compatibility fields

- `shortcode_tag` — shortcode tag used to locate the published page when the route is not yet fully registry-driven
- `fallback_slug` — conventional fallback slug used when no linked page exists yet

### 4.4 Placement fields

- `after_key` — place the item after another managed item key
- `before_key` — place the item before another managed item key
- `parent_key` — nest the item under another managed item key

## 5. URL Resolution

The shared framework resolves the final menu URL from the item specification.

Resolution order:

1. explicit shared-framework-managed `url` when present for special internal items such as Logout
2. special shared-framework route handling where required, such as `my-profile`
3. `system_slug` via `TPW_Core_System_Pages::get_permalink()`
4. `shortcode_tag` plus `fallback_slug` via the shared shortcode-page resolver
5. conventional `site_url( '/{fallback_slug}/' )` fallback

Add-ons should prefer `system_slug` for new managed plugin screens.

## 6. Ordering Rules

The shared framework normalizes the final managed item order before repair or seeding.

Rules:

- `parent_key` places a child after its parent in the managed-item sequence
- `after_key` and `before_key` adjust the managed sequence declaratively
- `logout` is always forced to the last managed position

The shared framework uses the normalized managed order during repair and seeding.

## 7. Duplicate Prevention

Managed duplicate prevention is key-based. During a declared canonical/legacy migration, legacy keys are normalized to the canonical key before duplicate prevention and repair matching.

Current matching order during repair or seeding:

1. `_tpw_member_menu_default_key`
2. `_tpw_page_slug`
3. normalized URL matching
4. bootstrap title matching for initial migration or first repair compatibility

The item `key` is the canonical unique identifier. Add-ons must keep keys stable once released.

## 8. Stored Metadata

The shared framework stores the following metadata on managed nav menu items:

- `_tpw_member_menu_default_key`
- `_tpw_member_menu_provider`
- `_tpw_page_slug`
- `_tpw_requires_login`
- `_tpw_visibility_json`

This metadata is used for repair, visibility filtering, and provider lifecycle handling.

## 9. Provider Lifecycle

If a previously managed item is no longer present in the current managed-item registry, the shared framework may remove that managed nav-menu item during repair or seeding.

This rule applies only to shared-framework-managed items carrying managed metadata.

The shared framework must not delete or rewrite arbitrary site-owned custom items.

Implications:

- plugin activation: the add-on starts contributing its managed item spec through the filter
- plugin deactivation: the add-on stops contributing the spec, and the next shared-framework repair or seed pass may remove that stale managed item
- plugin uninstall: no extra custom-menu cleanup path is required if the managed item is already removed by the normal shared-framework repair flow

## 10. Visibility Contract

Managed Members Menu items use the current shared-framework menu visibility model:

- `requires_login`
- `visibility`

The shared framework owns the full visibility evaluation path for managed Members Menu items.

Add-ons must only declare metadata through the item specification. Add-ons must not implement separate front-end Members Menu visibility guards for those managed items.

Current `visibility` support is the same flat model already used by shared-framework-managed Members Menu items, including:

- status arrays under `status`
- role or flag booleans such as `is_admin`, `is_committee`, `is_match_manager`, `is_noticeboard_admin`, and `is_gallery_admin`

Add-ons must still enforce direct access in their own shortcode, router, POST, AJAX, or file-serving code. Menu visibility is not a security boundary.

## 11. System Pages Relationship

Plugin-owned Members Menu destinations should be registry-driven through System Pages when they represent a canonical plugin front-end screen.

Recommended pattern:

1. register the plugin page through `TPW_Core_System_Pages::register_page()`
2. ensure the page exists through the normal plugin/shared-framework lifecycle
3. reference that route from the Members Menu item via `system_slug`

`shortcode_tag` and `fallback_slug` remain compatibility paths, not the preferred contract for new plugin-owned screens.

## 12. Example: FlexiEvent

Target managed item:

- `key` => `flexievent-events`
- `provider` => `flexievent`
- `title` => `Events`
- `after_key` => `noticeboard`
- `before_key` => `members`
- `requires_login` => `true`
- `visibility['status']` => current allowed member statuses

Example registration:

```php
add_filter( 'tpw_core/member_menu_items', function( $items, $context ) {
    $items[] = [
        'key'            => 'flexievent-events',
        'provider'       => 'flexievent',
        'title'          => __( 'Events', 'flexievent' ),
        'system_slug'    => 'events',
        'after_key'      => 'noticeboard',
        'before_key'     => 'members',
        'requires_login' => true,
        'visibility'     => [
            'status' => ! empty( $context['allowed_statuses'] ) && is_array( $context['allowed_statuses'] )
                ? array_values( array_map( 'strval', $context['allowed_statuses'] ) )
                : [ 'Active', 'Honorary', 'Life Member' ],
        ],
    ];

    return $items;
}, 10, 2 );
```

## 13. Validation Expectations

When changing or extending this area, validate all of the following:

1. the managed item is seeded once and not duplicated on repeated repair runs
2. the managed item lands in the intended relative position among other managed items
3. logged-out users do not see member-only items
4. allowed members do see the item
5. provider-managed items disappear cleanly from the managed menu after the provider stops registering them
6. custom site-owned menu items are not deleted or rewritten by the managed repair flow
7. no add-on-local `wp_nav_menu_objects` visibility filter is required for a managed Members Menu item
