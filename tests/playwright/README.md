# iLungu Club Playwright Tests

The maintained iLungu Club browser suite is
`tests/playwright/smoke/ilungu-branding-smoke.spec.ts`.

The contribution contract suite is
`tests/playwright/club-administration-contributions.spec.ts`. It requires the
Local-only WordPress test bootstrap to define `ILUNGU_CLUB_PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING`
and require `tests/playwright/fixtures/club-administration-contributions.php`.
The fixture is request-scoped: it registers synthetic contributions only when
the spec supplies its test query flag, creates no persistent state, and does
not load outside that explicit Local test bootstrap.

Run the current smoke suite with:

```sh
npm run test:ilungu-smoke
```

`tests/playwright/playwright.config.ts` sets `testDir` to `tests/playwright` and
matches the smoke and contribution-contract specs. This keeps the maintained
existing-install, authenticated-admin, portal/workspace, and fresh-install
fixture checks separate from historical diagnostics.

Use `.env.example` as the placeholder reference. Put local site credentials only
in `.env.local`; it is ignored. Generated `test-results`, Playwright reports, and
blob reports are also ignored. The full `tests/playwright` directory is excluded
from public release packages.

## Historical diagnostics

The original May 2026 FlexiClub dashboard and payment investigation scripts were
removed from the working tree because they contained hard-coded local login
details, targeted a retired local site, and provided no unique maintained
coverage. They remain available in Git history for forensic reference only; do
not restore or run them as regression tests.
