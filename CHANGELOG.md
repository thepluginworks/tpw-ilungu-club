# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Members: added the read-only `tpw_member_office_secretary` and `tpw_member_office_treasurer` office-state predicates through `tpw_core_user_can()`. They report only the linked member record's corresponding current office flag; they do not create a WordPress role or capability and do not alter existing authorization mappings.
- Core compatibility: added canonical/legacy aliases for email-template groups, payment-log sources, System Page providers, Club Administration contribution keys, and managed Members Menu item keys. The aliases use canonical writes and legacy reads without bulk rewriting site data.

### Fixed
- Notices: aligned `tpw_notices_manage` with the active Noticeboard management rule so the Core permission bridge recognises configured Noticeboard Admin members as well as WordPress Administrators.

### Changed
- Admin routing: standardised iLungu Club Settings and every Core-owned Settings tab on `admin.php?page=tpw-flexiclub-settings`; native WordPress Settings no longer contains an iLungu Club submenu. Legacy `options-general.php?page=tpw-core-settings` URLs redirect to the canonical Club route while preserving valid tab context.

## [2.11.1] - 2026-09-16

### Changed
- Payments: documented the canonical payment-method eligibility contract. Checkout-safe methods must be released, administrator-active, configured, and runtime-available; stored active state alone is not customer-facing eligibility. SumUp and WooCommerce are documented as unreleased dormant compatibility records.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added
- Club Management: introduced the canonical `/club-management/` System Page and front-end management workspaces for settings, system pages, logs, menu management, and archival tools.

### Changed
- Distribution: renamed the physical plugin identity, updater channel, release package, and GitHub release artifacts to iLungu Club while retaining shared TPW Core identifiers, stored contracts, and legacy compatibility paths.
- System Pages: the front-end workspace now displays the product-facing iLungu Club owner label while preserving `tpw-core` as the technical ownership marker.

### Fixed
- System Pages: canonical page provisioning now rejects unrelated occupied paths and maintains collision-safe ownership checks.
- Club Management: restored full-width portal layout and front-end-compatible settings form submission.

### Changed
- Branding: renamed the public product from FlexiClub to iLungu™ Club. Existing technical identifiers, directory names, shortcodes, and database keys remain unchanged for backwards compatibility; this change introduces no functional or data migration.

## [2.10.2] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- Payments: fixed Square/Core checkout frontend error visibility so mount, config, or SDK failures written to `#tpw-square-errors` are shown to checkout users instead of remaining hidden by inline `display:none`.

## [2.10.1] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed
- Payments: restored creation of the shared `tpw_rsvp_payments` table during activation and added an existing-site repair path so payment rows can be created reliably again for ticketing and other TPW checkout flows.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- Email: added a durable email queue backed by Action Scheduler, including queue status visibility, retry handling, and reconciliation recovery for pending rows that lose their scheduled action.

### Changed
- Email: preserved immediate-send semantics for existing immediate-sensitive workflows while routing queue-safe notifications through the explicit background queue API.
- Members: shipped the related shared admin and member workflow safeguards alongside the queue rollout.

## [2.9.2] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed
- Admin UI: adjusted scoped TPW button styling so `.tpw-btn-*` variants retain their intended typography.

## [2.9.1] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- Noticeboard: restored normal WordPress single-template resolution for individual `tpw_notice` permalinks so active themes and Elementor Single templates can take ownership by default, while retaining the legacy bundled single template only through an explicit compatibility filter.
- Noticeboard: limited the legacy `notice-single.css` enqueue path to the compatibility fallback template so Elementor- or theme-owned single notices do not inherit the bundled fallback styling unexpectedly.

### Changed
- Noticeboard: aligned the `tpw_notice` custom post type registration with clearer plural labels and explicit public-facing args so builders can expose cleaner all-notice single-template conditions without changing the current Noticeboard permalink structure.
- Documentation: clarified that individual notice permalinks follow normal WordPress single-template resolution by default and documented the compatibility filter for sites that still need the bundled single template.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-06-01

### Changed
- System Pages: promoted the Core-owned Manage Members and Noticeboard routes into first-class registry-backed System Pages, while preserving the existing shortcode access controls and compatibility fallbacks.
- System Pages: runtime provisioning now reuses existing published Manage Members and Noticeboard slug or shortcode pages and persists the canonical System Pages mapping and metadata so legacy installs migrate without duplicate pages.
- Members Menu: the default Noticeboard and Members managed items now declare canonical `system_slug` destinations while retaining the existing shortcode and fallback-slug compatibility paths.
- Documentation: updated the canonical System Pages contract and related help and developer references so Manage Members and Noticeboard are documented as registry-backed Core System Pages.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-05-29

### Changed
- Members Menu: added a Core-owned managed item registration contract so add-on plugins can contribute Members Menu entries through a shared filter/registry instead of writing nav-menu items directly.
- Members Menu: centralized managed item visibility evaluation in FlexiClub/Core so add-ons only declare login and visibility metadata and no longer need local `wp_nav_menu_objects` guards for managed Members Menu items.
- Documentation: added the canonical Members Menu registration contract and linked the relevant developer and help indexes to the new add-on integration guidance.

### Fixed
- System Pages: restored logged-out automatic page-list protection for both classic `wp_page_menu()` / `wp_list_pages()` output and block-theme `core/page-list` navigation fallbacks so private FlexiClub pages are hidden again for logged-out visitors.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-05-28

### Changed
- Members Menu: added a safer default FlexiClub Members Menu structure and repair flow so existing installs can restore the shared member navigation without requiring plugin reactivation.
- Menus: runtime visibility checks now recognise `is_gallery_admin` consistently when shared menu visibility rules are evaluated.
- System Pages: added a canonical system page protection contract and linked the relevant developer and help docs back to that shared Core reference.
- Noticeboard: the default front-end Noticeboard is now members-only by default while preserving existing notice management access for authorised admins and noticeboard managers.

### Fixed
- System Pages: logged-out automatic page-list protection now covers both classic `wp_page_menu()` / `wp_list_pages()` output and block-theme `core/page-list` navigation fallbacks so private FlexiClub pages are not exposed automatically.
- Members Menu: existing-install repair paths now restore the default Members Menu items even when the menu location is already assigned, and the shared settings screen now exposes an explicit repair action.

## [2.6.1] - 2026-05-27

### Changed
- Noticeboard: documented the canonical module shortcode, assets, and legacy compatibility copies so future integrations use the active `modules/notices/*` runtime path.

### Fixed
- Noticeboard: updated the front-end notice editor modal shell so the active module script opens the flex-based modal layout correctly and keeps the improved scrolling and mobile sizing behaviour.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-05-21

### Changed
- Front end: added Payment Method detail routing inside the FlexiClub Settings workspace so supported offline methods open and save within the portal instead of relying on wp-admin routes.
- Payments: reused the existing offline gateway configuration forms and save flows for Bank Transfer, Cheque, Cash, and Card on the day inside the front-end Settings workspace while preserving current option keys and existing wp-admin settings pages.
- Payments: removed SumUp and WooCommerce from the shared FlexiClub Payment Methods settings list in both wp-admin and the front-end Settings workspace while those methods remain development-only surfaces.
- Payments UI: aligned the shared Payment Methods list layout across wp-admin and the front-end Settings workspace so the Enable control is larger and the centered status state uses the same pill treatment in both contexts.

### Fixed
- Front end: Payment Methods Configure/Edit actions now stay inside the FlexiClub Settings workspace for supported methods, and unsupported methods now show a clear temporary admin fallback instead of broken or incorrect links.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-05-20

### Changed
- Front end: split the legacy FlexiClub Control surface into dedicated Menu Management and Archival System workspaces inside the `[flexiclub]` portal while keeping the existing `[tpw-control]` page available as a clearly labelled legacy transition workspace.
- Front end: added a new Logs workspace inside the FlexiClub portal, including source switching, pagination, clear actions, and front-end-safe email and payment log summaries built on the existing Core log infrastructure.
- System Pages: added additive Core registration and safe page creation for `menu-management`, `archival-system`, and `logs`, preserving existing shortcode and slug compatibility during rollout.
- Front end: expanded the portal route map so key dashboard actions, summary cards, settings links, and compatible add-on management routes open their front-end destinations where available instead of defaulting back to wp-admin.
- Plugins: Extend FlexiClub cards now recognise front-end management destinations for supported ecosystem add-ons, including FlexiEvent, FlexiSubscriptions, FlexiLedger, FlexiTicket, and Lodge RSVP, and front-end activation flows now return authorised users to the relevant portal destination.

### Fixed
- Front end: fixed shortcode and system-page routing so the main `[flexiclub]` portal continues to open the dashboard by default, while the dedicated Logs page resolves only when explicitly targeted.
- Front end: fixed workspace URL generation and explicit `workspace` query handling so portal navigation buttons continue to open the intended front-end workspace instead of being overridden by page-level shortcode defaults.
- Front end: restored the dashboard layout on portal pages by ensuring the dedicated FlexiClub dashboard stylesheet is loaded during the normal front-end enqueue phase.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-05-20

### Changed
- Front end: added a new FlexiClub Settings workspace inside the `[flexiclub]` portal so authorised front-end managers can work with the existing Core settings tabs without leaving the portal.
- Settings: reused the shared Branding, Features, Member Menu, Email Settings, Email Templates, Email Logs, and Payment Methods tab renderers, validation, save handlers, and redirect flows in the new front-end workspace without changing option keys or the existing wp-admin settings page behaviour.
- Payments: adapted the main Payment Methods settings surface for front-end workspace use, including front-end-compatible permission checks, redirect context, and sortable save wiring, while keeping gateway-specific detail screens on their existing admin pages.

### Fixed
- Front end: improved the Settings workspace presentation so Branding inputs have clearer spacing and the Email Templates and Payment Methods actions keep the intended TPW admin-style button and layout treatment when rendered inside front-end themes.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- System Pages: fixed Unlink in both the wp-admin and FlexiClub front-end workspaces so clearing a page assignment now persists as an explicit unlinked state instead of being immediately rediscovered by slug or shortcode lookup; unlink leaves the WordPress page intact, refreshes into the correct missing or needs-attention state, and now shows clearer success or failure notices.

### Changed
- Admin: added a new top-level FlexiClub wp-admin menu that groups existing Core admin screens and front-end bridge launchers without changing legacy routes such as Settings -> FlexiClub, Noticeboard CPT URLs, TPW Control URLs, or Payment Logs under Tools.
- Admin: replaced the temporary FlexiClub dashboard launcher table with a polished wp-admin operations dashboard that keeps the existing menu slugs, bridge pages, compatibility routes, and current management screens intact while surfacing safe status summaries, quick actions, onboarding guidance, and ecosystem add-ons.
- Front end: added a new `[flexiclub]` shortcode that renders a FlexiClub portal dashboard with shared KPI, checklist, status, ecosystem, and existing FE tool-routing logic while keeping plugin-owned dashboards and current wp-admin tooling intact.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed
- Fixed FlexiClub System Pages "Re-create" so it uses the same option-backed page registry as registration and lookup. Missing registered pages, including FlexiEvent Event Admin, can now be restored, and AJAX failures now return clearer error messages instead of a generic "Operation failed".

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-14

### Changed
- System Pages: administrators can now clear stored system page mappings and recreate canonical FlexiClub system pages directly from the settings screen.
- System Pages: page recreation now preserves clearer error handling for missing slugs, trashed pages, and page creation failures so recovery is more reliable.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-14

### Changed
- Members: `tpw_members_module_enabled()` now defaults to enabled on standalone FlexiClub sites when the Core members table exists or the members module has already been provisioned, while preserving the existing constant and filter override architecture.
- Payments: the main FlexiClub `Payment Methods` settings tab is now hidden by default unless a plugin declares payments are required via `tpw_core/payments_required`, with legacy `tpw_show_payment_settings` still honored for backwards compatibility.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed
- Updates: corrected the public manifest and release download endpoints used by the built-in GitHub updater so FlexiClub installs check the renamed `tpw-flexiclub` repository and GitHub Pages manifest location correctly.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-14

### Changed
- Release delivery: renamed the plugin package, bootstrap file, updater metadata, and public release artifacts from `tpw-core` to `tpw-flexiclub` so the distributed FlexiClub product name, install package, and update manifest now align.
- Menus: theme overrides can now use `theme/tpw-flexiclub/menus/menu-modal.php`, while existing `theme/tpw-core/menus/menu-modal.php` overrides remain supported for backward compatibility.
- Documentation: refreshed installation, branding, developer, and security references so deployment and integration guidance points to the new FlexiClub plugin paths.

## [1.30.0] - 2026-05-14

### Changed
- Branding: updated the plugin header, admin settings labels, updater metadata, and release workflow surfaces to use the FlexiClub product name consistently.
- Email: the default shared email footer branding now shows FlexiClub.
- Documentation: refreshed the public readme and admin help copy so the shared platform is described consistently as FlexiClub.

## [1.29.0] - 2026-05-11

### Changed
- UI: TPW Core now provides a reusable shared UI enqueue helper for the canonical `tpw-ui`, `tpw-admin-ui`, and `tpw-buttons` styles so shared wrapper-based screens can load the Core UI stack more consistently.
- UI: shared TPW buttons, app navigation, cards, notices, tables, and form styling now apply consistently inside `.tpw-frontend-ui` as well as `.tpw-admin-ui`, improving frontend wrapper protection for shared Core interfaces.
- Documentation: added the canonical TPW Core shared UI wrapper and enqueue contract and linked the relevant help and architecture guides back to that source of truth.

## [1.28.2] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed
- UI: shared admin tab and button selectors now include `.tpw-admin-ui`-scoped counterparts so TPW admin interfaces keep their intended styling when rendered inside admin wrapper contexts that do not match the original unscoped selectors.

## [1.28.1] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- Payments: Square billing verification now normalizes billing-contact country values to ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes before tokenization, maps supported UK variants such as `UK`, `England`, and `Scotland` to `GB`, and omits invalid free-text values unless a valid configured site-country fallback is available.

## [1.28.0] - 2026-05-07

### Changed
- UI: added a reusable `.tpw-app-nav` navigation pattern with dedicated primary and secondary variants so TPW admin and front-end interfaces can render button-like workspace and detail navigation from the shared Core stylesheet.
- UI: app navigation links now resist theme underline overrides, keep the intended secondary-button inactive styling for primary nav items, and preserve the accent-filled active state with accessible hover, focus, disabled, and responsive wrapping behaviour.

## [1.27.0] - 2026-04-30

### Changed
- Members: added compatibility-era `tpw_members.is_secretary` and `tpw_members.is_treasurer` storage, seeded those fields into Manage Members, and grouped the in-scope Core access and office flags under a new `Access & Office Roles` section on Add/Edit Member screens.
- Members: protected Manage Members permission-field enforcement now includes `is_secretary` and `is_treasurer`, while keeping `is_admin` special-case WordPress administrator synchronisation intact.
- Permissions: documented and implemented the Phase 1 Core compatibility read path through `tpw_core_user_can()`, including `tpw_members_manage`, `tpw_payments_manage`, and `tpw_events_manage` office-role mappings without widening unrelated module migrations.
- Members: Add Member now rolls back the newly created linked WordPress user if member-row persistence fails, preventing orphan partial creates on add failures.
- Members: linked TPW administrator saves now promote the linked WordPress user to `administrator` as the primary WordPress role when `is_admin = 1`, while preserving explicit authorised removals and stale-mismatch repair on later saves.

## [1.26.2] - 2026-04-29
### Changed
- Members: linked TPW administrator state now stays synchronised with the linked WordPress `administrator` role for linked members. Existing linked WordPress administrators auto-heal `tpw_members.is_admin` upward, missing `is_admin` checkboxes preserve the current state, explicit ticks grant administrator, and explicit unticks remove administrator only when intentionally submitted from an editable admin field.

## [1.26.1] - 2026-04-29
### Changed
- Members: linked member and WordPress user email addresses now stay synchronized across admin edits, WordPress profile edits, self-service profile email changes, and existing-user CSV imports.
- Members: Edit Member now blocks password setup sends when linked email drift exists, shows the true WordPress recipient address clearly, and reduces synced-state UI noise.

## [1.26.0] - 2026-04-24
### Changed
- Members: [tpw_member_profile] now includes a dedicated Change Password tab where linked members can update their own password from the front end using current-password verification and WordPress-native password handling.
- Members: password change success and error notices now remain scoped to the Change Password tab instead of being carried into sibling profile-tab URLs.

## [1.25.0] - 2026-04-24
### Changed
- Members: CSV member imports now stage password setup recipients only for newly created and linked WordPress users, then present a post-import action to send secure setup emails after the import completes.
- Members: the CSV import results screen now shows password setup eligibility, excluded-row counts, and final sent, failed, skipped, and remaining totals for each import run.
- Members: CSV import password setup sending now runs through a protected batched admin-post flow with transient-backed progress tracking so imports do not send email inline and authorised managers can resume a saved run safely.

## [1.24.0] - 2026-04-24
### Changed
- Members: Add Member now includes an enabled-by-default option to send a secure password setup email immediately after creating a linked WordPress user for the new member.
- Members: linked members now show a dedicated resend password setup action in Edit Member, including targeted success and error notices in Manage Members.
- Email: TPW Core now registers a dedicated `member_password_setup` template so password setup subject and body overrides can be managed from the Email Templates settings tab.

## [1.23.5] - 2026-04-21
### Changed
- UI: updated the shared light button selector so link elements using `.tpw-btn-light` receive the same light button styling as button elements.

## [1.23.4] - 2026-04-14
### Fixed
- Members: corrected the front-end member login and password reset flows so submitted passwords are unslashed consistently before WordPress authentication and reset APIs run, preventing quoted or slashed passwords from being saved and checked differently.
- Members: reset and login notices now persist reliably across redirects, clear stale reset errors after a successful password change, and show a clear success notice after password reset completion.
- Members: the member login shortcode now renders login, lost-password, and reset-password states separately so the normal login page no longer includes a competing hidden auth form that can interfere with password-manager autofill.

## [1.23.3] - 2026-04-14
### Changed
- TPW Control: moved Upload Pages admin styling out of the section template and into the existing scoped TPW Control stylesheet, preserving the current interface behaviour while reducing template-embedded presentation code.
- TPW Control: centred the existing TPW Control shell within the viewport using the existing `.tpw-control` container, keeping the current sidebar and content layout structure unchanged.

## [1.23.2] - 2026-04-07
### Fixed
- Updates: the WordPress plugin details modal now reads Description and Changelog content from the bundled `readme.txt`, so GitHub-delivered TPW Core updates show the intended release information without depending on `CHANGELOG.md` in the installed package.

### Changed
- Documentation: refreshed the public-facing `readme.txt` description so the plugin details modal and install readme better explain TPW Core's role in the ThePluginWorks plugin ecosystem.

## [1.23.1] - 2026-04-07
### Fixed
- Members: fixed a regression where clearing the TPW `is_admin` flag on a linked member could leave the linked WordPress account with the `administrator` role and continue granting admin access.
- Members: centralized member-to-WordPress role synchronization in the member controller so linked users are re-synced consistently when `user_id`, `status`, or `is_admin` changes.

## [1.23.0] - 2026-04-07
### Changed
- Members: added a dedicated Privacy settings tab so member visibility and profile-sharing controls are separated from general member system settings.
- Members: added a configurable, extensible privacy-override setting for view-only access so selected roles or capabilities can bypass member privacy restrictions without gaining member management permissions.

## [1.22.1] - 2026-04-07
### Changed
- Members: refined the self-service profile editor for the member visibility checkbox with clearer spacing, a larger touch target, and a simpler inline Yes label.
- Members: the shared admin label for the visibility field is now neutral, while the member-facing profile page keeps the fuller explanatory wording.

## [1.22.0] - 2026-04-07
### Changed
- Members: added a member-controlled profile visibility setting so standard members can opt out of appearing in member-facing directories, detail views, contact actions, and related member selection lists.
- Members: management views and authorised admin or manager access continue to bypass member-to-member visibility restrictions.

## [1.21.2] - 2026-04-07
### Changed
- UI: refined shared primary and secondary TPW button classes so they consistently keep the configured padding, height, and border-radius tokens across shared button usage.

## [1.21.1] - 2026-04-07
### Changed
- UI: refined primary TPW button styling so shared primary button classes consistently keep the configured padding, height, and border radius tokens.

## [1.21.0] - 2026-04-07
### Changed
- UI: added configurable large button tokens for `.tpw-btn-lg`, including large font size, padding, and height values that now emit as shared branding CSS variables in both admin and front-end output.
- UI: reorganised the Branding settings page so button-specific controls sit with the Buttons section and the scoped UI Theme section appears after Semantic Notice Colours.

## [1.20.1] - 2026-04-07
### Changed
- UI: updated the shared TPW button stylesheet to provide a consistent outline button variant for primary and secondary buttons.
- Members: refined FlexiGolf activation detection used for conditional member/admin field visibility.

## [1.20.0] - 2026-04-02
### Changed
- Menus: TPW Control menu management now supports the `is_gallery_admin` visibility flag across add-item flows, edit-item saves, current-item summaries, and the edit modal visibility UI.
- Menus: editing a menu item from the menu-manager modal now preserves the existing menu position, parent, and structural nav-menu metadata so item edits no longer push the entry to the bottom of the menu.
- Menus: Match Managers visibility is now conditionally rendered from the existing FlexiGolf activation gate in both add and edit flows, and the edit modal now captures that gate correctly inside the nested tree renderer.
- Members: FlexiGolf activation detection now recognises TPW FlexiGolf bootstrap constants and loader classes in addition to the existing legacy markers.

## [1.19.0] - 2026-04-01
### Changed
- Members: TPW Core now stores a canonical `membership_entitlement` value on member records through a dedicated `tpw_members` column, with strict normalization so only allowed machine values persist and invalid submissions collapse back to unset.
- Members: membership entitlement is now a Core-owned field with dedicated helper filters for visibility and option values, allowing dependent plugins to enable the admin field and supply code-controlled labels without relying on loose field-settings options.
- Members: the Add Member and Edit Member entitlement select is hidden by default, only appears when enabled by a dependent plugin, and default or fallback member downloads continue to omit the field while it remains hidden.

## [1.18.0] - 2026-03-30
### Changed
- Menus: added a front-end admin dining menus management screen with create, edit, delete, course naming, and course choice management flows for authorised administrators when the dining menus module is enabled.

## [1.17.1] - 2026-03-27
### Changed
- UI: refined the shared TPW button stylesheet so link-style buttons consistently suppress link underlines and secondary buttons keep the intended rounded corners across supported contexts.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-03-26
### Changed
- Members: new WordPress users created through Add Member, admin create/link, CSV import, and signup finalization now receive system-generated usernames derived from member name data, with deterministic numeric suffixes when needed.
- Members: CSV import now generates new usernames by default for new WordPress users and adds an explicit preserve-imported-usernames mode for migration scenarios, while keeping final resolved usernames aligned between `wp_users.user_login` and `tpw_members.username`.
- Members: normal member admin and profile surfaces now treat usernames as internal identifiers for new accounts instead of a manually managed field, without renaming existing users or changing login and password-reset behaviour.

## [1.16.0] - 2026-03-25
### Changed
- Members: linked member email updates now synchronize `tpw_members.email` and the linked WordPress account email together across self-service profile edits, admin Edit Member saves, and existing-member signup finalization, while preserving existing usernames.
- Members: linked email sync now handles duplicate-email conflicts, broken linked-user records, drift-heal cases where only one side is stale, and rollback when a WordPress email update fails after the member record changes.
- Members: the Member Field Settings screen now uses stronger non-auth autofill suppression and page-local safeguards to reduce unwanted browser or password-manager injection into label, section, custom-field, and search-option inputs.
- Members: the core `username` field label remains visible in Member Field Settings but is now fixed in the UI and enforced server-side so posted overrides are ignored.

## [1.15.7] - 2026-03-25
### Changed
- Maintenance: removed the bundled Freemius SDK, bootstrap include, and Core-side startup call now that TPW Core updates are fully handled by the GitHub release manifest flow.
- Maintenance: retained the existing manifest fetch, update injection, GitHub release packaging, and normal plugin runtime behaviour without further updater logic changes.

## [1.15.6] - 2026-03-25
### Changed
- Updates: removed temporary upgrader trace hooks, request-scoped trace summaries, and the admin-only updater refresh helper now that release validation is complete.
- Maintenance: retained the existing manifest fetch, cache bypass, update injection, and upgrade cache-clearing behaviour without further updater logic changes.

## [1.15.5] - 2026-03-25
### Changed
- Maintenance: clarified updater inline documentation without changing TPW Core runtime behaviour.

## [1.15.4] - 2026-03-25
### Changed
- Updates: TPW Core now logs the exact WordPress upgrader stage reached during one-click updates, including the package URL handed to WordPress and the final upgrader result.
- Updates: upgrader diagnostics now capture precise `WP_Error` codes, messages, and data for remote download failures, filesystem credential or write-access failures, unpack or package validation failures, and plugin replacement failures.
- Maintenance: each traced update request now records a concise end-of-request summary so failed upgrades can be classified quickly without changing updater behaviour.

## [1.15.3] - 2026-03-25
### Changed
- Updates: reduced temporary updater diagnostics so short-term validation keeps signal for active update checks and remote manifest failures without the previous debug noise.

## [1.15.2] - 2026-03-25
### Changed
- Updates: TPW Core now bypasses stale manifest data during WordPress plugin update checks so new releases appear reliably in scheduled checks and after using Dashboard > Updates > Check Again.
- Updates: updater cache refresh now clears both the TPW Core manifest cache and WordPress plugin update cache automatically when WordPress performs an active check or after a TPW Core upgrade completes.
- Maintenance: temporary updater diagnostics now log whether cached or freshly fetched manifest data was used, alongside the installed version, available version, and final update injection decision.

## [1.15.1] - 2026-03-25
### Changed
- Maintenance: removed the obsolete `scripts/freemius-deploy.php` helper as part of updater release validation.

## [1.15.0] - 2026-03-25
### Changed
- Updates: TPW Core now injects update metadata on both the plugin update check path and the cached plugin update read path, so available releases surface more reliably in Plugins and Dashboard > Updates.
- Updates: version comparisons now resolve against the installed TPW Core plugin version reported by WordPress, reducing the risk of stale or mismatched update decisions.
- Maintenance: updater cache clearing now refreshes both the TPW Core manifest cache and WordPress' plugin update cache after upgrades and manual refresh checks.
- Maintenance: added tightly scoped temporary updater diagnostics and an admin-only refresh trigger to support release validation and troubleshooting.

## [1.14.43] - 2026-03-24
### Changed
- Documentation: refreshed the public plugin readme so setup notes, shortcode references, and release notes are clearer for site owners and administrators.
- Documentation: simplified the public repository overview for GitHub visitors while keeping the full developer and internal documentation set in the repository.

## [1.14.42] - 2026-03-24
### Changed
- Updates: TPW Core now checks the public TPW version manifest and registers available updates through WordPress' standard plugin update system.
- Updates: plugin information for TPW Core now includes the current available version, release download link, and homepage details for a clearer in-dashboard update experience.
- Maintenance: manifest responses are cached to keep update checks lightweight and reduce unnecessary remote requests.
- Maintenance: this release adds update detection only; no new admin UI has been introduced.

## [1.14.41] - 2026-03-24
### Changed
- Release delivery: TPW Core now publishes its canonical install package through the public release channel used for site downloads.
- Release delivery: tagged and manual release runs now build a filtered `tpw-core.zip`, preserve the correct `tpw-core/` archive root, and refresh the published asset when needed.
- Release delivery: release automation now generates a public `tpw-core.json` version manifest so TPW Core and companion plugins can detect updates from a stable URL.
- Maintenance: this release changes packaging and distribution only; plugin runtime and admin UI behaviour are unchanged.

## [1.14.40] - 2026-03-24
### Changed
- Members: the Sign Ups debug screen is now hidden from normal admin menus while remaining available by direct link for authorised administrators when signup debug mode is enabled.
- Members: signup attempt records now exclude temporary debug and schema trace data, reducing stored noise while preserving the information needed for completion and support.
- Maintenance: TPW Core now loads translations early enough to avoid WordPress admin timing warnings and removes temporary debug logging across payments, menus, postcode lookups, CSV import tools, and TPW Control.
- Maintenance: postcode lookups now use the configured site default country when available, falling back to GB when no site preference has been set.
- Maintenance: Core now records a lightweight support warning for older member records that still use a legacy `society_id = 0` value, without rewriting historical data automatically.

## [1.14.38] - 2026-03-23
### Changed
- Distribution: corrected plugin commercial metadata so the plugin is no longer marked as using paid plans or freemium access.
- Distribution: metadata now matches the current TPW Core distribution model, reducing the risk of incorrect plan-related prompts or state handling.

## [1.14.37] - 2026-03-23
### Changed
- Members: TPW Core now standardises the canonical site society assignment on the Core-owned `tpw_site_society_id` option, defaulting current single-site installs to `1`.
- Members: signup finalization, manual member creation, and create-from-user flows now resolve new member records through the canonical site society value instead of mixing hardcoded defaults, empty fallbacks, or inferred existing-member data.
- Members: household creation and related member society resolution paths now resolve to the same canonical positive site society value, so new real member and household rows no longer default to `0`.
- Maintenance: this release establishes the correct source of truth for new entity creation but does not rewrite historical legacy rows that already have `society_id = 0`.

## [1.14.36] - 2026-03-23
### Changed
- Members: signup finalization now preserves the intended society assignment for new member records by preferring society information already carried by the completed Join attempt.
- Members: finalized Join requests no longer fall back to an unrelated default society when provider or request context already includes the correct society value.
- Members: Core still uses the existing default society fallback when no society information is present, preserving compatibility for existing single-society setups.

## [1.14.35] - 2026-03-23
### Changed
- Members: the Sign-Ups settings UI now marks `email`, `first_name`, and `surname` as Core-required baseline Join fields and keeps them visible but locked in configuration.
- Members: administrators can no longer disable those baseline Join fields from the public signup schema, reducing broken paid Join setups when TPW Subscriptions depends on Core readiness.
- Members: server-side Sign-Ups settings saves now force those baseline fields to remain enabled and required, preventing tampered requests from disabling them.

## [1.14.34] - 2026-03-20
### Changed
- Packaging: excluded `uninstall.php` from the generated release zip so package validation no longer rejects the TPW Core deployment archive.
- Packaging: kept the existing `.distignore`-driven build flow unchanged so published release assets continue to use the same filtered package.
- Maintenance: no TPW Core runtime, uninstall logic, or plugin behaviour changed in this release.

## [1.14.33] - 2026-03-20
### Changed
- Release delivery: replaced the previous custom deployment client with an SDK-based publishing flow for tagged releases.
- Release delivery: tagged release publishing now uses a pinned SDK version on the runner and logs returned upload and release payloads more clearly when publishing fails.
- Maintenance: kept package building, GitHub release asset uploads, and plugin runtime behaviour unchanged while simplifying the Freemius deployment path.

## [1.14.32] - 2026-03-20
### Changed
- Release delivery: corrected deployment request signing so tagged publishing now follows the expected SDK rules for canonical paths, multipart uploads, and signatures.
- Release delivery: retained the existing diagnostics so failed publishing attempts still surface the HTTP status and returned API response clearly.
- Maintenance: kept package building, GitHub release asset uploads, and plugin runtime behaviour unchanged while fixing the Freemius signing path.

## [1.14.31] - 2026-03-20
### Changed
- Release delivery: replaced the rejected Basic Auth publishing path with the correct signed API deployment flow for plugin tags.
- Release delivery: tagged release uploads now log returned tag metadata and fail explicitly when either the upload or the follow-up release-state change is rejected.
- Maintenance: kept package building, GitHub release asset uploads, and plugin runtime behaviour unchanged while correcting the Freemius publishing path.

## [1.14.30] - 2026-03-20
### Changed
- Release delivery: updated tagged publishing to use curl's built-in Basic Auth handling, avoiding malformed authorization headers during uploads.
- Release delivery: kept the existing upload diagnostics in place so release runs still show the requested version, package path, HTTP status, response body size, and raw response when available.
- Maintenance: no plugin runtime, payment flow, or front-end behaviour changed in this release.

## [1.14.29] - 2026-03-20
### Changed
- Release delivery: expanded tagged upload logging so release runs now show the package path, requested version, response body size, and raw response when available.
- Release delivery: added a clear fallback message when a publishing response body is empty, making failed uploads easier to diagnose from release logs.
- Maintenance: enabled shell trace output for the Freemius upload step to improve release debugging without changing plugin runtime behaviour.
- Maintenance: no plugin runtime, payment flow, or front-end behaviour changed in this release.

## [1.14.28] - 2026-03-20
### Changed
- Release delivery: hardened the publishing step so release runs now report the HTTP status and response body returned for each tagged upload.
- Release delivery: failed package uploads now fail the workflow immediately instead of appearing as successful runs.
- Maintenance: updated the release workflow checkout action from `actions/checkout@v3` to `actions/checkout@v4`.
- Maintenance: no plugin runtime, payment flow, or front-end behaviour changed in this release.

## [1.14.27] - 2026-03-20
### Changed
- Packaging: updated the release workflow to build plugin zips from the existing `.distignore` file so non-runtime docs, editor files, and metadata are excluded consistently.
- Packaging: published GitHub releases now receive the filtered plugin zip as a release asset, and Freemius deployments use the same filtered package.
- Maintenance: removed the obsolete Composer install step from the packaging workflow now that TPW Core no longer has a root Composer manifest.

## [1.14.26] - 2026-03-20
### Changed
- Maintenance: removed the remaining top-level Composer manifest and lockfile from TPW Core because Core no longer has any direct Composer-managed runtime dependencies.
- Maintenance: retired the last dead bundled Composer package set from Core so the plugin no longer relies on the top-level `vendor/` tree or Composer autoload artifacts.
- Maintenance: no business logic, payment flows, or Square add-on behaviour changed in this release.

## [1.14.25] - 2026-03-20
### Changed
- Maintenance: removed stale Composer vendor packages so the shipped `vendor/` directory now matches the current lockfile after Square SDK externalisation.
- Maintenance: regenerated the production dependency bundle from the current Composer manifest, leaving only Guzzle and its required PSR/support packages in Core.
- Maintenance: no functional plugin behaviour or payment flows changed in this release.

## [1.14.24] - 2026-03-20
### Changed
- Payments: Core no longer ships the Square PHP SDK and now treats Square checkout ownership as an external TPW Square Gateway add-on concern.
- Payments: preserved the existing Square slug, settings surface, and legacy gateway class boundary while replacing the in-Core Square gateway implementation with an unavailable compatibility shim when the add-on is not active.
- Payments: front-end payment method discovery, payments page config, and checkout validation now keep Square unavailable when the add-on is inactive, preventing broken Square selection on forms.
- Payments: the Payment Methods admin UI now keeps stored Square configuration visible, prevents re-enabling Square while the add-on is inactive, and restores the requested active state when the add-on becomes available again.
- Maintenance: version bump to 1.14.24.

## [1.14.23] - 2026-03-18
### Added
- Members: added a runtime Join provider registry so the Core-owned Join page can keep using `[tpw_join_form]` while dispatching to the active Join experience.

### Changed
- Members: `tpw_join_form` now dispatches safely between the built-in Core Join flow and registered external shortcode-based providers, while keeping Core as the default and fallback provider.
- Members: added an Active Join Provider setting to the existing Members sign-up settings and stored the provider key inside the existing `tpw_members_settings` option.
- Members: hardened the managed Join page so it sends no-cache headers even when an external Join provider is active, reducing stale cached Join content after provider switches.
- Maintenance: version bump to 1.14.23.

## [1.14.22] - 2026-03-18
### Changed
- Members: aligned the signup finalizer in [modules/members/signups/class-tpw-signup-finalizer.php](modules/members/signups/class-tpw-signup-finalizer.php) with the Core identity architecture so canonical `tpw_members` creation or linking now happens before any WordPress identity projection is applied.
- Members: signup finalization now reuses or links an existing canonical member row for the resolved WordPress user, including weak-linkage repair by email or username where that resolves unambiguously, instead of failing or creating duplicate member records.
- Members: signup finalization now preserves an existing member record's canonical status when one already exists, writes the configured default status only when a member row is newly created or missing status, and returns normalized `member_status` plus projected `identity_role` in the success result.
- Members: signup finalization is now idempotent for already-completed attempts with valid stored refs, and new WordPress users created through the signup path no longer receive the `member` role before the canonical member status is known.
- Identity: added a narrow Core-owned projection helper in [modules/members/includes/class-tpw-member-roles.php](modules/members/includes/class-tpw-member-roles.php) so the signup path assigns `member` only for membership-bearing statuses and removes legacy identity roles for non-membership-bearing statuses.
- Maintenance: version bump to 1.14.22.

## [1.14.21] - 2026-03-17
### Changed
- Members: updated the Member Details modal flag-read path in [modules/members/includes/class-tpw-member-ajax.php](modules/members/includes/class-tpw-member-ajax.php) to source legacy member flags through the compatibility helper boundary.
- Members: kept the existing Member Details modal labels, ordering, formatting, field visibility, and Yes/No rendering logic unchanged.
- Members: preserved existing behaviour for direct-link, missing-member, email-fallback, and username-fallback scenarios by falling back to the original member row unless the compatibility lookup resolves back to the same member record.
- Maintenance: version bump to 1.14.21.

## [1.14.20] - 2026-03-17
### Changed
- Documentation: added [docs/architecture/identity/member-flag-ownership-model.md](docs/architecture/identity/member-flag-ownership-model.md) as the formal Phase 2C Member Flag Ownership & Classification Model.
- Documentation: classified the current `tpw_members` member flags by ownership, system role, migration risk, and migration difficulty to freeze the safe migration boundary.
- Documentation: clarified that these member flags are compatibility-era signals rather than canonical identity and that the release does not change runtime behaviour.
- Documentation: updated [docs/architecture/README.md](docs/architecture/README.md) to link the new member-flag ownership reference alongside the existing identity architecture set.
- Maintenance: version bump to 1.14.20.

## [1.14.19] - 2026-03-17
### Changed
- Identity: adopted `TPW_Identity` and `TPW_Identity_Compat` inside the read-only Identity Audit admin class as the first narrow internal Core usage of the Phase 2A helper layer.
- Identity: migrated only the audit-reporting methods for user linkage analysis, identity role projection, unknown role reporting, and drift reporting.
- Identity: preserved the existing report semantics and avoided permission, authority, role, member-flag, or admin-elevation behaviour changes.
- Maintenance: version bump to 1.14.19.

## [1.14.18] - 2026-03-16
### Changed
- Documentation: clarified in [docs/architecture/identity/identity-permissions-decisions.md](docs/architecture/identity/identity-permissions-decisions.md) that `tpw_members.is_admin` is a Core administrative elevation signal rather than an ordinary compatibility-era responsibility flag.
- Documentation: added [docs/architecture/identity/role-classification-model.md](docs/architecture/identity/role-classification-model.md) guidance for Core administrative elevation signals that affect WordPress Administrator assignment and site-level authority.
- Documentation: recorded that any redesign of TPW-managed WordPress Administrator assignment must be handled as an explicit architecture decision, not helper migration or flag cleanup.
- Maintenance: version bump to 1.14.18.

## [1.14.17] - 2026-03-16
### Added
- Identity: added `TPW_Identity` as the first Phase 2A helper-layer scaffold for canonical member lookup, raw and normalized status access, linkage-mode reporting, and canonical membership checks.
- Identity: added `TPW_Identity_Compat` to centralize compatibility-era member-flag reads plus legacy WordPress role and identity-alias checks.

### Changed
- Identity: preserved the current weak-linkage compatibility path by resolving members through direct `user_id` linkage first, then the existing email and username fallback paths when enabled.
- Identity: loaded the new helper classes through the existing Core members bootstrap without broad internal call-site migration.
- Maintenance: version bump to 1.14.17.

## [1.14.16] - 2026-03-16

- Documentation: updated [docs/architecture/identity/identity-permissions-implementation-roadmap.md](docs/architecture/identity/identity-permissions-implementation-roadmap.md) with compatibility-layer rules to prevent new direct dependencies and reduce privilege escalation risk during migration.
- Maintenance: version bump to 1.14.16.

## [1.14.15] - 2026-03-16
### Added
- Identity: added a new read-only Identity Audit screen under TPW Core Settings as the first Phase 1 safety tooling for the identity and permissions implementation roadmap.
- Identity: the audit reports user/member linkage, weak-linkage fallback matches, projected identity roles, unknown assigned roles, member status distribution, and drift indicators without modifying data.

### Changed
- Documentation: updated [docs/architecture/identity/identity-permissions-implementation-roadmap.md](docs/architecture/identity/identity-permissions-implementation-roadmap.md) to reference the new TPW Core Identity Audit tooling.
- Maintenance: version bump to 1.14.15.

## [1.14.14] - 2026-03-16

- Maintenance: version bump to 1.14.9.

## [1.14.8] - 2026-03-16
### Added
- Members: added a signup finalization service that converts eligible `members_join` signup attempts into WordPress users and TPW member records.
- Members: added a schema-driven signup field mapper that splits allowed signup fields into WordPress user data, TPW member fields, and member meta values.
- Members: added a controlled internal completion bridge and privileged recovery action so draft Join attempts can be advanced through a non-gateway success path before finalization.
- Members: added a temporary Sign Ups (Debug) admin screen so privileged users can review signup attempts and trigger internal completion through WordPress.

### Changed
- Members: finalization now persists created `wp_user_id` and `member_id` references into the signup attempt result payload as soon as they exist, so partial progress can be resumed safely.
- Members: failures after finalization begins now mark the attempt as `finalization_failed` with structured error context instead of leaving the attempt stranded.
- Members: finalized member accounts now apply the existing Core defaults for society resolution, member status, and member capability assignment.
- Members: the internal completion path now records explicit non-gateway provenance in the signup attempt result payload and event log before the existing finalizer runs.
- Maintenance: version bump to 1.14.8.

## [1.14.6] - 2026-03-15
### Added
- Members: added public Join page auto-provisioning and the public `[tpw_join_form]` shortcode for the Branch 3 sign-up flow.
- Members: added schema-driven Join form rendering with section-aware field output, validation, sticky values, and a public confirmation state with a shortened reference code.

### Changed
- Members: valid Join submissions now create and redirect to a recoverable signup attempt confirmation without creating a TPW member record or WordPress user in this branch.
- Members: Sign-Ups settings now expose only public-safe fields, remove the Signup Safe admin column, apply better default field enablement and ordering, and support drag-and-drop field ordering with improved initial grouped display.

- Members: added a new Core sign-up attempts table to store in-progress onboarding state, payment progress, retry data, lifecycle locks, and recovery timestamps before permanent account creation.
- Members: added a generic Core signup attempts service for creating, loading, updating, and tracking sign-up attempts across future TPW onboarding flows.

### Changed
- Members: enforced strict lifecycle transitions for draft, payment, finalization, completion, expiry, and abandonment states so sign-up processing stays predictable and resumable.
- Members: added generic helpers for public tokens, request fingerprints, UUID generation/validation, payment state updates, finalization locking, cleanup, and event logging.
- Members: wired the new signup attempts engine into the Core activation and upgrade bootstrap so the schema is created consistently on new and upgraded sites.
- Maintenance: version bump to 1.14.4.

- Members: protected permission fields `is_admin` and `is_manage_members` are now visible but read-only for non-administrator managers, with server-side enforcement to block privilege escalation through form tampering or AJAX requests.
- Maintenance: version bump to 1.14.0.

## [1.13.3] - 2026-03-10
### Added
- Members: added a new core boolean member field `is_gallery_admin` with the label `Gallery Admin`.

- Members: `is_gallery_admin` now follows the same Core checkbox-style handling pattern as `is_noticeboard_admin` across schema upgrade, field settings, profile protections, add/edit forms, and the member details modal.
- Gallery: the active front-end gallery admin shortcode and gallery management AJAX/template paths now allow only WordPress admins with `manage_options`, TPW members with `is_admin = 1`, or TPW members with `is_gallery_admin = 1`.
- Gallery: gallery admin access now resolves through a shared helper so page rendering and action handlers stay aligned.
- Maintenance: version bump to 1.13.3.

## [1.13.2] - 2026-03-10
### Added
- Members: added `TPW_Member_Field_Loader::get_condition_eligible_custom_fields()` to return enabled custom checkbox fields that are explicitly allowed for conditional field logic.

### Changed

- Maintenance: version bump to 1.13.2.

## [1.13.1] - 2026-03-10
### Changed
- Notices: active front-end noticeboard management now allows TPW noticeboard admins via `TPW_Control_UI::is_noticeboard_admin()` while preserving existing WordPress admin access.

- Email: log retention is enforced automatically with a daily cleanup that removes entries older than 30 days.
- Maintenance: version bump to 1.13.0.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-03-10
### Added
- Members: My Profile tabs now render from a pluggable profile sections registry, allowing add-on plugins to register their own front-end profile tabs through `tpw_core_register_profile_sections`.

### Changed
- Members: the built-in Profile and Payments sections now use the same normalized section registry, priority sorting, and active-section rendering flow.
- Email: added `TPW_Email::dispatch_mail()` as the shared outbound dispatcher with support for throttling, centralized logging, and slot reservation.
- Email: feedback submissions and member-facing plain-text notifications now route through the shared dispatcher when available.
- Maintenance: version bump to 1.12.0.

## [1.11.2] - 2026-03-09
### Added
- Scheduler: added wrapper diagnostics via `TPW_Core_Scheduler::get_wrapper_diagnostics()` to expose the loaded wrapper file, detected Action Scheduler source/version, and pre-filter registration state.

- Maintenance: version bump to 1.11.0.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-03-08
### Added
- Gallery: added a same-page gallery browser via `tpw_gallery_index` and a dedicated Gallery Index Elementor widget.

### Changed

- Branding: branding/heading CSS variables are now only output on TPW admin screens; on the front-end they output only when TPW styles are enqueued (filters: `tpw_core/should_output_branding_vars`, `tpw_core/should_output_heading_vars`).
- Maintenance: version bump to 1.9.4.

## [1.9.3] - 2026-02-18
### Fixed
- Members Login: preserve full redirect destinations (including nested query args) through the front-end password reset email link and post-reset redirect.

### Fixed

## [1.7.1] - 2026-01-23
### Added
- Members: new setting (default off) to optionally show adult family members on the primary member profile.

### Changed
- Members Directory: member-facing directory list and detail modal only allow primary members.
- Members: dependants/children are never displayed to other members (hard privacy rule).
- Members Admin: improved Household UI on Edit Member (household members list, clearer change controls, safer defaults and validation).

## [1.7.0] - 2026-01-20
### Added
- Scheduler: added `TPW_Core_Scheduler` as the single source of truth for background scheduling across TPW plugins.
- Action Scheduler: Core now provides a lazy init wrapper that uses an existing Action Scheduler instance when present (e.g. WooCommerce) or loads Core's bundled copy when needed.
- Scheduler API: wrappers for single + recurring actions, unscheduling, and basic query helpers, with default group `tpw`.

### Notes
- TPW plugins should call `TPW_Core_Scheduler::init_if_needed()` early (e.g. on `plugins_loaded`) instead of bundling Action Scheduler themselves.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-01-13
### Added
- Members: optional Household support (default off) with new admin tools on the Edit Member screen to create households and attach/move members.
- Members: new core field Date of Birth (DOB).
- Members: select field option lists via `field_options` (one option per line) for enabled select fields.

### Changed

## [1.5.2] - 2026-01-07
### Added
- Gallery: new `show_heading` attribute for `[tpw_gallery]` (and Elementor widget) to hide the gallery title/description above images.

### Changed
- Gallery Admin: caption editing now uses a textarea modal suitable for long captions (shared across modal + full-page editors), with clamped caption previews to keep card heights stable.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-01-06
### Fixed
- Notices: Noticeboard list shortcode thumbnail now links to the notice (image is clickable).

## [1.5.0] - 2025-12-23
### Added
- Gallery Pagination: New shortcode attributes `per_page` and `paginate` for `[tpw_gallery]` in `grid` and `list` views to limit how many thumbnails render at once.
- Elementor: Optional TPW Gallery Elementor widget (loads only when Elementor is active) supporting Grid/List/Story views.

### Changed
- Caching: Gallery shortcode cache key now varies by pagination query args to avoid serving the wrong page.
- Public UI: Pagination controls added for grid/list; fixed-column rendering uses a CSS variable for more predictable layouts.
- Story view: Preloads previous/next images and sets `decoding="async"` on the story image for smoother navigation.

### Docs
- Gallery docs expanded with Story view, pagination, and Elementor widget usage.

### Notes
- No database schema changes.

## [1.4.0] - 2025-12-23
### Added
- Gallery Help: New front-end help page for the Gallery module accessible at `/gallery-help/` via shortcode `[tpw_gallery_help]`.

### Docs
- Comprehensive Gallery Admin documentation covering image management, reordering, captions, focal points, and category handling.
- Cross-linked help topics and updated references in README.

### Notes
- No database schema changes.
- Front-end help page is auto-created by System Pages when the Gallery module is enabled.

## [1.2.3] - 2025-11-21
### Added
- New shortcode `[tpw_profile_badge]` providing a standalone circular profile/login badge (40px). Supports optional `dropdown="yes"` for a hover (desktop) / tap (mobile) profile menu (My Profile, Logout).
- Accessible dropdown: `aria-haspopup`, `aria-expanded` with touch-device JS; ESC/outside tap closes on mobile.

### Changed
- Avatar fallback logic (badge): Member photo → real WP avatar (excluding placeholder grey silhouette) → initials from member `first_name` + `surname` → `display_name` → `user_login`.
- Styling consolidated with CSS variable `--tpw-profile-size: 40px` for easy theme override; enforced perfect circle across avatar and initials.

### Fixed
- Eliminated display of default placeholder avatar (grey silhouette) in profile badge; initials now show when no true photo exists.
- Dropdown position refined (flush against badge, no dead hover gap) ensuring reliable pointer transition.

### Docs
- Added `docs/members/tpw_profile_badge.md` covering usage, dropdown behaviour, accessibility, and override examples.

### Notes
- No database schema changes.
- Menu injection/profile avatar logic untouched; changes isolated to shortcode, CSS, JS, docs.

## [1.2.1] - 2025-11-20
### Changed
- Refactor: Features and Member Menu tabs now save independently via dedicated `admin_post` handlers to prevent the WordPress Settings API from overwriting unrelated options when one tab is saved.
- Removed legacy `register_setting` usage for `tpw_core_default_login_page`, `tpw_login_redirect_page_id`, and `tpw_member_menu_location` (now updated atomically per tab).
- Added explicit nonces and capability checks for new save actions.

### Fixed
- Eliminated cross-tab resets where saving Features reverted Member Menu location and vice versa.

### Notes
- No database schema changes; existing option values are preserved.
- Other tabs (Branding, Email, Templates, System Pages) remain unchanged and continue using their existing handlers.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-11-13
### Added
- Implement consistent branded header for payment settings pages.
- Ensure default courses are created automatically when a menu is inserted.
- Add rename warning script for course choice form to prevent accidental edits.
- Add `tpw_normalise_value()` and apply normalisation across menu classes.
- Ensure `wp_delete_user()` is available outside wp-admin context for member deletion.

### Fixed
(none)

### Changed
(none)

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-28

- docs: Updated Admin Help content and inline developer annotations for clarity. Improved README with Core overview, relationship to dependent plugins, key components, hooks summary, and extension examples. Added @since/@param/@return tags and filter/action notes in major classes and settings renderers to mirror FlexiEvent 1.1.0 documentation style.
- docs: Expanded annotation coverage across Members, Postcodes, and Menus modules (class-level and public methods) and added a centralized "Core Hooks Index" to `docs/developer-guide.md` listing actions/filters with file references and since tags.
- docs: Added per-module Help topics under `docs/help/` for Members, Payments, System Pages, Menus, Postcodes, Access Control, TPW Control, Feedback, Gallery, and Notices. Each page links back to the Core Hooks Index.
- docs: Aligned Branding help (`docs/help/tpw-branding.md`) to the standardized sections and added a "See also: Core Hooks Index" footer link.
- docs: README now includes a "Developer Documentation" section linking to the Developer Guide and the Help topics index.
- docs: Finalized documentation suite with per-module Help index and cross-linking across README, Developer Guide, and Help topics. Ready for 1.1.0 release.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-27

- Fix: Upload Pages lightbox could open the wrong file. In table/list layouts each file was rendered with two preview anchors using the same data-index (icon and label), causing the lightbox index to desync. Rendering updated to use a single anchor per file and the JS lightbox now scopes navigation to the clicked Upload Page instance and resolves items by data-index to avoid mismatch.
- Fix: Upload Pages “Edit Visibility” settings were not obviously persisting. The modal now includes a Save Visibility button that submits the page form so changes are saved immediately.
- Change: Upload Pages visibility now grants access if any selected role OR any selected status matches (OR semantics). For example, ticking Admins and Status: Active allows either group to view the page.
- Security: The secure file serving endpoint now applies the same OR visibility semantics as page rendering for consistent access control.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-21

- First stable, public release.
- Core RSVP, guests, and payments logic stabilized.
- WooCommerce HPOS compatibility declaration.
- Freemius SDK integration and onboarding.
- Admin settings UX improvements and security hardening (nonces, escaping).
- Postcode lookup AJAX with nonce verification.
- Thank You page shortcode and templates.

Security: Added global no-cache safeguard for /manage-members/ admin views to prevent stale nonces.
