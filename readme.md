# iLungu™ Club

iLungu Club is the free foundation plugin used by iLungu Club-powered sites and add-on plugins. It provides the shared member, payment, page, branding, and admin tools that the wider ecosystem relies on.

## What iLungu Club is

iLungu Club is the central service layer for iLungu Club-powered sites. It helps administrators run consistent member journeys, shared pages, payments, and reusable admin tools across the plugin suite.

This repository keeps the public overview concise while preserving the deeper implementation and architecture documentation in the repo for development use.

## What it provides

- Shared member and profile features
- Shared payment methods and payment records
- Front-end login, profile, and join flows
- System page registration for iLungu Club plugins
- Shared iLungu Club settings, branding, and admin UI assets
- Common utilities such as email and postcode lookup support

## Plugins that depend on it

iLungu Club is intended to support ecosystem plugins such as:

- event and RSVP add-ons
- payments-enabled modules
- members and join-flow extensions
- gallery, notices, menus, and control tools

If a plugin expects shared member, payment, or front-end account functionality, it will typically depend on iLungu Club being active.

## Installation and updates

1. Install and activate iLungu™ Club in WordPress.
2. Install any add-on plugins that depend on it.
3. Review the shared settings under iLungu Club -> Settings in wp-admin.
4. Confirm that required pages such as login, profile, join, or thank-you pages are set up for your site.

iLungu Club includes its own update and packaging flow so production sites receive the intended install package structure.

The physical WordPress plugin identity is `tpw-ilungu-club/ilungu-club.php`. When migrating an existing installation, deactivate `tpw-flexiclub/tpw-flexiclub.php` at its current activation scope before activating the new plugin. Do not activate both copies together.

**Compatibility note:** iLungu™ Club was previously named FlexiClub. Some internal plugin identifiers, directory names, shortcodes and database keys retain the legacy FlexiClub naming to preserve backwards compatibility.

## Key admin areas

- iLungu Club top-level wp-admin menu for core navigation, with bridge pages for front-end-only management tools
- iLungu Club -> Settings for shared configuration such as branding, payments, and platform options
- Member-related iLungu Club screens used by dependent plugins
- iLungu Club front-end workspaces for dashboard, Menu Management, Archival System, settings, and system-page operations
- iLungu Club Control retained as a legacy transition workspace where older links or shortcodes are still in use

## Common public shortcodes

- `[flexiclub]`
- `[flexiclub_menu_management]`
- `[flexiclub_archival_system]`
- `[tpw_member_login]`
- `[tpw_member_profile]`
- `[tpw_join_form]`
- `[tpw_thank_you]`
- `[tpw-control]`

Exact shortcodes used on a site depend on which iLungu Club modules are active.
